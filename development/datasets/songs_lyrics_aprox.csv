34,34,Songs about a brother or sister,40 Acres,Pusha T,"[Hook: The-Dream]
Trouble world, trouble child
Trouble times destroyed my smile
No change of heart, no change of mind
You can take what's yours but you gon' leave what's mine
I'd rather die, than go home
I'd rather die, than go home
And I ain't leaving without my 40 acres

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Unpolished, unapologetic
This cocaine cowboy pushed it to the limit
You thought Tony in that cell would've made us timid
We found his old cell, bitch, we searchin' through the digits
Anything Spanish, got me speaking Spanglish
Money universal, that's the only language
The dream ain't die, only some real niggas
We was born to mothers who couldn't deal with us
Left by fathers who wouldn't build with us
I had both mine home, let's keep it real niggas
My better half chose the better path, applaud him
Younger brother me a spoiled child, I fought him
I heard that the Devil's new playground is boredom
The California top just falls back like autumn
And they say I'm on the verge of winning
I claim victory when Malice on the verge of sinning
Old habits die hard
That rainy day bag buried in the backyard
It's heaven for a hustler, no graveyards
Cause stand up niggas don't lie on no floors
Much rather burn us, ashes to ashes
Mix us with the powder, sell us to the masses
We gon' keep it tight, rip it off the plastic
Now you celebrate motherfuckers raise your glasses
Push

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Unpolished, unapologetic
Might have broke a heart or two but gave an honest effort
My nonchalant attitude is always eff it
35 years of marriage and my momma left it
You shouldn't question if you ever stood a chance with him
The better question is did you enjoy the dance with him
(Yughh!) I'll probably never pull you chair out, bitch
You know this money grew your hair out, switch
All that shit I bought you wear out
Rich, and I'm the only one I care about
Place none above me, God don't like ugly
Hate me or love me, only he can judge me
Unpolished, unapologetic
Big willie with the blow, niggas, I am legend
School of hard knock, I attended
Selling hard rock, fuck who I offended
I was a goner, punished by karma
Called him tar baby now he's transcending genres
The 911 came with the ass shots
A toothless crackhead was the mascot
The owner of the key to that padlock
I'm Jordan vs Cavs for the last shot
I need all mine, reparations
We growin' poppy seeds on my 40 acres

You always think you know the better thing to do
But in this case you could be wrong
So you chuck off your shoes with an empty smile on
your face
What is the problem with you?
Youre constantly in a mood and youve gotta shake it
off
Its getting on top of you again
Everything that I say is the icing on the cake and
Youve gotta laugh at it
And put it behind you, put it behind you

Chorus
Stop, I'm not your number one enemy
I'm not your number one enemy
If you wanna be a part of me
I'm not your number one enemy

Verse 2
So, now youve got this far
Do you really want to start again on your own
You say youre eternally scarred,
But its nothing we cant fix while youre at home

I'm not your number one enemy
All of you seem to be getting me
A little confused with the way that youre treating me
again
We get along every now and then
We need to tie up the loose ends.
I know that it will be alright,
let's stay in and talk tonight

Stop, I'm not your number one enemy

And say good-bye

Before your kisses take me
Before your eyes can make me stay

Wonder whose arms will hold you good and tight

Welcoming in the New Year

Can you hear me running,
can you hear me calling you?
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running,

Use it only in emergency.
Better you should pray to God, the father,
and the spirit will guide you and protect you from up here.

Can you hear me?
Can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running,
can you hear me calling you?
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running,
can you hear me calling you?

Never hint at what you really feel.
Teach the children quietly for someday sons and daughters,
will rise and fight while we stood still.

It doesn't seem like it was long ago
When you carved our names in these old chairs of oak
Soakin' up Heaven countin' all the stars
Talkin' 'bout babies how the future ain't so far
I hope they have your brown eyes and forever loving heart

Don't stop rockin' with me baby
Without you it wouldn't be the same
Don't stop rockin' with me baby rockaway
Just rockaway

The lights like an ocean off of our front porch
Movin' like waves swayin' back and forth

Oh, you want me to touch you right there?
Oh, like a little lamb, play in your hair
Oh you want it? Oh you want it right now
Like that? I got you baby
All on you baby
Push it back on daddy
Push it back on daddy baby

I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory, life is
I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory
Life is long as infinity this was the final calling
No birds chirping or flying, no dogs barking
We all nervous and crying, moving in caution
In disbeliefs our believe's the reason for all this
The tallest building plummet, cracking and crumbling
The ground is shaking, swallowing young woman
With a baby, daisies
and other flowers burning in destruction
The smell is disgusting, the heat is unbearable
Preachers touching on boys run for cover, they paranoid
Rapists and murderers hurdle alleys
Valleys and high places turn into dust
Famous screaming in agony
Atheists for suicide, planes falling out the sky
Trains jumping off the track, mothers yelling ""he's alive""
Backpedaling christians settling for forgiveness
Evidence all around us the town is covered in fishes
Ocean water dried out, fire burning more tires out
Tabernacle and city capital turned inside out
Public bathroom, college classroom's been deserted
Another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it
(It's happening) no more running from world wars
(It's happening) no more discriminating the poor
(It's happening) no more bad bitches and real niggas
Wishing for green and gold the last taste of allure
I swore I seen it vividly
A moniker of war from heaven that play the symphony
Thunder like number four, then I heard
""What have you did for me""
I fell to my knees, pulled out my resume
That dated back to June 17th, 1987
My paperwork was like a receipt
I was valedictorian, I was fearful of judgment
But confident I had glory in all my past endeavors
Close my eyes pray to god that I live forever
Dark skies, fire and brimstone some of us sent home
Some of us never did wrong but still went to hell
Geez Louise I thought you said that I excel
I made To Pimp a Butterfly 'fore you told me
To use my vocals to save man-kind for you
Say I didn't try for you, say I didn't ride for you
I tied for you, I pushed the club to the side for you
Who love you like I love you?
Crucifix, tell me you can fix
Anytime I need, I'mma start jotting everything in my diary
Never would you lie to me
Always camaraderie, I can see, our days been numbered
Revelation greatest as we hearing the last trumpet
All man, child, woman, life completely went in reverse
I guess I'm running in place trying to make it to church

Young nigga act an ass
Young nigga act a fool
Young nigga get yo' cash
Young nigga do what it do
Young nigga go, young nigga go
Young nigga go, young nigga go
Whatever makes all of you happy in this bitch
Just take it all back before the light switch",aprox,200,untitled 01 | 08.19.2014.

The whole world was ending
Right before my eyes
There were fires and there were floods
And everyone was running out of time
Made me wonder what I'd do
If we really came to the end of the life

I don't think I'd spend my last hours at an altar
Or somewhere making toasts to good old days
The more I think about it
All I'd really wanna do
Is watch the world end with you

I'd lay down in a field by your side
And watch every star fallin out of the sky
And I'd steel a kiss from your sweet lips
One last time
And I wouldn't be afraid
As long as your hand was in mine

I don't think I'd spend my last hours at an altar

He could handle anything
He was my granddad
He grew his own food
And he could fix his own car
I watched it all happen
In our backyard

He'd re-invent the part to fix a broken home
He'd restore the heart

Well, I wish I was a fixer
I would fix you up inside
I would build you a town if the world fell down
I wish I was that guy

Well, if Frank D. Fixer were alive today
Well, he might laugh at me
Or he may have a lot to say
He might ask that I keep working for the family
To keep the bills all paid
And be his protégé

What happened to the ground right where we are?
What happened to the family farm?

Well, I wish I was a fixer
I would fix you up inside
I would build you a town if the world fell down
I wish I was that guy

Every evening breaking bread
He showed us who a real man is
No matter what my grandma said
He would never lose his head

Well, I wish I was a fixer
I would fix you up inside
I would build you a town if the world fell down
I wish I was that guy

Well, I wish I was a farmer
I would grow you a Garden of Eden
And I would bless our family with the gifts
My granddad handed me
How wonderful that would be
Maybe I'll make that guy be me",aprox,200,Frank D. Fixer

They used to tell me
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all just remember one thing
Remember one thing
That one man could change the world
That one man could change the world

[verse 1: big sean]
All I, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars
And a bad chick
Imagine this so much some nights it felt like that I had it
Back on the mattress
Starin' at the ceilin' tryna to connect the dots
But its hard makin' those attachments
I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day
You know?
My - my step brother used to flip them bags
Outside the crib like it was trash day
No kim k, but he bagged yay (ye)
But when you're getting fast money, slow down, don't crash
With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas
Look, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it
Tell your team about it
Go make million dollar schemes about it
Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance
Used to look up at the stars
And be like ain't too much that's different
I be shinin', they be shinin'
Get your one shot don't you miss it
What you know bout' wakin' up everyday l
Ike you on a mission?

My grandma told me if you write your name in stone
You'll never get the white out
I grinded out that black hole
Then performed up at the white house
Standin' next to jim carrey, we traded stories then laughed
I said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks
Where I'm from I swear they broke
They need way more than the cast
We need more than what you have
And then we need more than that
But how am I supposed to say I'm tired
If that girl from west virginia came up in conditions
That I couldn't survive
Went to war, came back alive
On top of that became a female black captain
When being black you had to extra extra try
Way before james brown made us proud
She bought a crib on the same street as marvin gaye
Right there on outer drive, and she taught me how to drive
And she raised the kids
Then the kids' kids, and she did it right
Taught me how to love, taught me not to cry
When I die, I hope you teach me how to fly
All my life you've been that angel in disguise saying

so please don't pour me no liquor

fight the urge to go retaliate
Carry on, just be strong enough to walk away
Uh, speak the truth even if they crucify me
Uh, free my soul even if they chain my body
Uh, look to God if ain't nowhere to go
Beware those prophets
that touch a leg before they touch your soul
We reap what the sow when the boat man cometh
Gotta pay what we owe
Jesus walks so I run to him

Praying to a sky all black
Looking at the stars like they finna talk back
Looking at my phone like she finna call back
But last night I feel like probably ended all that
Cause by now she woulda sent a text in all caps
Then another one tryna take all back
Saying fuck you, I miss you or I hate you so much
Cause girls only say ""hate you"" to the guys they love
I know, I know, I know
The highs, the lows it comes and goes
You say ""be real"" I try, I don't
Cause you take anything and just make it everything
Kept my phone on silence every since you got a ring
(funny right?)
And I never cheated (I mean, maybe once, twice)
One time don't change everything
She ask why I don't feel the same, I'm still the same
She's still insane and now she's saying

But it looks like you're gettin' over me

Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone

I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s

Back then, I could've convinced myself
That maybe you called when I was out
But you didn't know what to say, so you didn't leave a message
And that you're probably at home right now, sound asleep
'Cause goin' out isn't really your thing
And I wouldn't have a clue what you been up to lately
Or who you been up to it with
But when I don't miss your calls, I miss you callin'
And I go 'round and 'round again

I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone

Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see

This is the last time I'll drive this way again
Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray
Cause I, I still love you but I can't

And all I have is your sympathy

On the dresser, vacant just like me
I see your writing on the dash
Then back to your hesitation

Guess I never doubted it

Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past

But can we still be friends
Things just can't go on like before
But can we still be friends
We had something to learn
Now it's time for the wheel to turn
Grains of sand, one by one
Before you know it, all gone

Let's admit we made a mistake
But can we still be friends
Heartbreak's never easy to take
But can we still be friends

Don't waste time feeling hurt

how we follow the path of the hero.

Boast about the day when the rivers overrun,
How we'll rise to the height of our halo.

Listen to the tales as we all rationalize,
our way into the arms of the savior.
Feigning all the trials and the tribulations.

None of us have actually been there,
Not like you...

Ignorant siblings in the congregation.
Gather around spewing sympathy,
Spare me...

None of them can even hold a candle up to you.
Blinded by choice, these hypocrites won't see.

But enough about the collective Judas.
Who could deny you were the one who illuminated?
Your little piece of the divine.

And this little light of mine, a gift you passed on to me
I'm gonna let it shine
to guide you safely on your way.

Your way home...

Oh, what are they gonna do when the lights go down?
Without you to guide them all to Zion*?
What are they gonna do when the rivers overrun,
Other than tremble incessantly.

High is the way,
but our eyes are upon the ground.
You are the light and the way.
They'll only read about.
I only pray heaven knows,
when to lift you out.

10.000 days in the fire is long enough.
You're going home...

You're the only one who can hold your head up high.
Shake your fist at the gates saying,
""I have come home now...!""
Fetch me the spirit, the son and the father.
Tell them their pillar of faith has ascended.

""It's time now!
My time now!
Give me my
Give me my wings...!""

Give me my [x5]

(Give me my wings)

You are the light, the way,
that they will only read about.

Set as I am in my ways and my arrogance.
Burden of proof tossed upon the believers.
You were my witness, my eyes, my evidence,
Judith Marie, unconditional one.

Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescence.
Difficult to see you in this light.
Please forgive this bold suggestion.
Should you see your maker's face tonight,
Look him in the eye.
Look him in the eye and tell him,
I never lived a lie, never took a life,
But surely saved one.

Hallelujah
It's time for you to bring me home.

Hard to read, hard to please, yeah that was my old man
On the day I left for college, it was nothing new
We never had the heart to heart, there was too much to do

He checked the air in my tires, 
The belts and all the spark plug wires
He said, when in hell's the last time you had this oil changed?
And as I pulled out the drive, 
He said be sure to call your mom sometime
And I didn't hear it then, but I hear it now, 
He was saying I love you the only way he knew how.

A 120,000 miles, six years down the road
A brand new life and a brand new wife 
And we'd just bought our first home
When he finally came to visit, I thought he'd be so proud
He never said he liked the place, he just got his tool belt out

And put new locks on the doors, 
Went back and forth to the hardware store
Said come and hold this flashlight, 
As he crawled beneath the sand
These old wires aint up to code 
And that old circuit box is going to overload
And I didnt hear it then, but I hear it now
He was saying I love you the only way he knew how

Last Sunday we all gathered for his 65th birthday, 
I knew hed stiffen up but I hugged him anyway,
When it was finally time to say goodbye I knew what was next, 
Just like he always does, right before we left

He checked the air in my tires,

No-one much around but us
Then I see this young boy cut a look at me
I'm stunned in a daze
He had the whole street set ablaze
It's only love they say
Makes you feel this way

She liked his eyes she wanted more
The baby gonna have your smile for sure
He saw a lovely girl
Smelling sweet and soapy like fresh air
She saw him looking acted like she didn't care

That's how we knew
And so love grew a flower
A flower that is you.

Under the shadows, forbidden and hot
Desire grows, more often than not

I'm sorry's a stupid thing to say
Especially considering it's not like I planned it this way

But I'm sorry is all that there is left of me
I'm so sorry this love left me hollow and made you empty

Maybe I could have loved you better
Maybe you should have loved me more
Maybe our hearts were just next in line
Maybe everything breaks sometime
Everything breaks sometime

It's hard to believe its boiled down to this
It seems so surreal this won't be healed by a kiss
It's hard to stare at you knowing you like I have
I used to feel so close, now I feel so bad

My heart's filled with thunderstorms and I'm ready to burst
And I've lost my favorite harbor and I'll weather for the worst

1408,1408,Songs about alcohol,Down Bound Train,Chuck Berry,"A stranger lying on a bar room floor 
Had drank so much he could drink no more, 
So he fell asleep with a troubled brain 
To dream that he rode on that down bound train. 
  
The engine with blood was sweaty and damp 
And brilliantly lit with a brimstone lamp, 
And imps for fuel was shovelling bones 
While the furnace rang with a thousand groans. 
  
The boiler was filled with lots of beer 
The devil himself was the engineer, 
The passengers were most a motley crew, 
Some were foreigners and others he knew. 
Rich men and lost beggars in rags 
Handsome young ladies and wicked old hags. 
  
As the train rushed on at a terrible pace 
Sulphuric fumes scorched their hands and face, 
Wider and wider the country grew 
Faster and faster the engine flew, 
Louder and louder the thunder crashed 
Brighter and brighter the lighting flashed, 
  
Hotter and hotter the air became 
Till their clothes were burned with each quivering refrain. 
Then out of the din there came a yell 
Ha ha said the devil we're nearing home, 
  
Oh how the passengers shrieked with pain 
They go to Satan with this down bound train. 
  
The stranger awoke with an anguished cry 
His clothes wet with sweat and his hair standing high, 
He fell on his knees on the bar room floor 
And prayed a prayer like never before. 
  
And the prayers and vows were not in vain 
For he never rode that down bound train.

Sown with pity and with scorn
The great and good, they never could
Recognise a prophet born
With poetry and engravings
He presented paradise
He revealed to them a Jerusalem
They would not recognise

When earth and faith did shake

There's one promise you must make
Dear William, if you're right
About life on the other side, about paradise

That you won't leave me when you leave

Embrace me you child, you're a child of mine
And I'm leaving everything I am to you
Go chase the wild and night time streets sang Daddy
And God sang, Pray the devil doesn't get to you

I thought together they must sing the moon away
I thought that they must know each other well
For the magic that they made, when they played
Wasn't lost between their Heaven and their Hell

Then one night Daddy died and went to Heaven
And God came down to earth and slipped away
I pretended not to (KNOW) I'd been abandoned

Made a seam to hem me in
There at the fair when our eyes caught, careless
Got my heart right pierced by a pin

All the bellies and the bones and the bile
Though I lingered here with the blankets barren
And my own belly big with child

Before you cross my mind

yeah, do you ever wonder?
What he might be going through on his own, and
The demons that he's facing alone

Yes, we do, baby

And you are a Camry

But we've been struggling endless days
Someday we'll find the love

I know it's hard
But did you even really try?
Maybe you could understand
When all you had to do was ask
And just open your mind
When everything is passing by
And all you had to do was try
Yeah, all you had to was try

Counting all the cracks backwards in my best french
Reminds me of a book I skim-read in a surgery
All about palmistry I wonder what's in store for me

I pretend the plaster is the skin on my palms
And the cracks are representative of what is going on
I lose a breath... my love-line seems entwined with death

I'm thinking of you too

I lie awake at three staring at the ceiling
It's kind of off-white... maybe it's a cream
There's oily residue seepping from the kitchen
It's art-deco necromantic chic
All the dinner plates are kitsch with
Irish wolf hounds
French baguettes wrapped loose around their necks
I think I'm hungry

And the cars fly through the (ballory?)

Alone, alone

A stone, a stone
And the tears won't even come
I feel so numb
So swept aside, so dumb
So dumb, so dumb

And my patience gone
Will you tell me
Does this mean you're moving on?

From the balcony, you call my name
I see you standing in the rain
Your words so dry, your face so wet
Said I broke your heart, 
But it hasn't happened yet
I'll bet, your friends all hate me now
I get the strangest looks, 
From that bitchy crowd
And though, they must think
They have every reason to
I guess I'm still not quite yet over you

I sit alone in my four-cornered room staring at candles
Oh that shit is on? Heh
Let me drop some shit like this here Real smooth

Verse One: Scarface

At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Candle sticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Four walls just staring at a nigga
I'm paranoid, sleeping with my finger on the trigga
My momma's always stressing I ain't living right
But I ain't going out without a fight
See, everytime my eyes close
I start sweatin, and blood starts comin out my nose
It's somebody watchin' the Ak' 
But I don't know who it is, so I'm watchin my back
I can see him when I'm deep in the covers
When I awake I don't see the motherfucker
He owns a black hat like I own
A black suit and a cane like my own
Some might say ""take a chill, G""
But fuck that shit, there's a nigga trying to kill me
I'm poppin' in a clip when the wind blows
Every twenty seconds got me peeping out my window
Investigating the joint for traps
Checking my telephone for taps
I'm staring at the woman on the corner
It's fucked up when your mind is playing tricks on you

Verse Two: Willie D

I make big money, I drive big cars
Everybody know me, it's like I'm a movie star
But late at night, somethin ain't right
I feel I'm being tailed by the same sucker's head lights
Is it that fool that I ran off the block
Or is it that nigga last week that I shot
Or is it the one I beat for five thousand dollars
Thought he had 'caine but it was Gold Medal Flour
Reach under my seat, grabbed my popper for the suckers
Ain't no use to be lying, I was scareder than a motherfucker
Hooked a left into Popeyeâ€™s and beared down quick
If it's going down let's get this shit over with
Here they come, just like I figured
I got my hand on the motherfucking trigger
What I saw'll make your ass start giggling
Three blind, crippled and crazy senior citizens
I live by the sword
I take my boys everywhere I go
Because I'm paranoid
I keep looking over my shoulder and peeping around corners 
My mind is playing tricks on me

Verse Three: Scarface

Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doing dope
Can't keep a steady hand because I'm nervous
Every Sunday morning I'm in service
Praying for forgiveness
And trying to find an exit out of the business
I know the Lord is looking at me
But yet and still it's hard for me to feel happy
I often drift when I drive
Havin fatal thoughts of suicide
BANG and get it over with
And then I'm worry-free, but that's bullshit
I got a little boy to look after
And if I died then my child would be a bastard
I had a woman down with me
But to me it seemed like she was down to get me
She helped me out in this shit
But to me she was just another bitch
Now she's back with her mother
Now I'm realizing that I love her
Now I'm feeling lonely
My mind is playing tricks on me

Verse Four: Bushwick Bill

This year Halloween fell on a weekend
Me and Geto Boyz are trick-or-treating
Robbing little kids for bags
Till a law man got behind our ass
So we speeded up the pace
Took a look back and he was right before our face
He'd be in for a squable no doubt
So I swung and hit the nigga in his mouth
He was going down, we figga'd
But this wasnâ€™t no ordinary nigga
He stood about six or seven feet
Now, that's the nigga I'd been seeing in my sleep
So we triple-teamed on him
Dropping them motherfuckin beads on him
The more I swung the more blood flew
Then he disappeared and my boys disappeared, too
Then I felt just like a fiend
It wasn't even close to Halloween
It was dark as fuck on the streets
My hands were all bloody from punching on the concrete
God damn, homie
My mind is playing tricks on me

With the widows of love
A new sound from the beaches
Be quiet hear them roar

I got no secrets I got no friends
But I got a hold of you
They say you're trouble I say you're fine

Your rose-colored socks
Your sun-bleached hair
You piss me off at times
I don't really care

You drop bombs on my head
You cut me with cheap knives
Make sure I never forget
There's a riot tonight

How a raging love
Can end and no one wins
I hate your delicate smile
Like a thief in the night

With the coming of spring
I jump-start my trip
A trip to behold
A trip I should skip

You'll go first and I'll grieve
It's too much to conceive
In dreams I picture this
The Uss Intrepid in the rain

You and I holding hands
While evil runs through your veins
At night they come to make you feel small
Or maybe they don't come at all

Hey, Miss Donda
You run into my mama, please tell her I said, ""Say something""
I'm startin' to believe ain't no such thing as Heaven's trumpets
No after-over, this is it, done
If there's a Heaven, you would think they'd let ya speak to your son
Maybe she has in the form of a baby's laugh
I heard passing by in a stroller remindin' me, ""Hey, keep rolling""
I don't know, maybe she has with a prick of a blade of grass
I've been layin' on way too long, got me itchy
Got up and roamed a lil' more
Miss Donda, you see my mama, tell her I'm lost
You see, she'd always light a cigarette, we talk, I would cough
Exaggeratin' a lil' bit so she get the point
Tryna get her to stop smokin', I would leave and fire up a *****
'Til I quit, started back up again, twenty years later
All that time, y'all thought a ***** was high, thought I was crazy

Got me back on track, I don't miss her overstepping
But do miss her showin' Seven civilian life ****
Ah, Miss Donda, you see my mama, whisper her this
The real reason I was geeked to go to church
Must confess, when y'all grown-ups would be in Bible study
That girl helping me with my homework? Her and I were ****
So pure and ****, so spirit spinning and dirty
So on, so on, and so on, we hoped that no one heard us
Sh-sh, ah, ah
And to this day, I think her mama knew but let us explore
Miss Donda, you see my father, please, ask him why he never married
Always smiled, but was he happy inside?
Because I carried my mother's name, did he carry shame with him?
I'm sure she did it out of spite, 'twas her decision at birth
Shit, she probably was hurt, ah, poor baby
Two young people with different views, a lot for a young lady
No coincidence, they both passed away from heart conditions
There's a dissidence at play, dad and mom do hard division
Three Thou', poster child for big **** **** raised by their mothers
I'm supposed to smile as if God knew that I would be troubled
Keeps me around, for what? I don't know
But I do know that it's crucial, that we do so, pronto
I don't know how much long though

You're still living through me
Listen

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Look, I lost my father to the bottle
I'd hug him everyday like I might not see him tomorrow
Got a enough sorrow for a lifetime
Cause when he was living I'm thinking how do I get him to listen
When he was seldom in his right mind
My early years I was too young to understand
But I remember the smell of beer and seeing all the empty cans
Waking up, crying in the night, hearing arguments
Hands off my momma, somehow I knew he was the cause of it
Got a little older and he got a little worse
Drinking must be his remedy, he got a little cursed
Well, tell me what's the cure for a man who miss his pops
The beat goes on, but the drinking's gotta stop

[Hook: Monica]
If I had have know I wouldn't see you tomorrow
I would've had you hold to your heart, and put your love in a bottle, hey
But now you got me drunk out that pain, gone after sorrow
Wishing every day you were here with me
But now that you're gone, I lost my heart to the bottle, to the bottle
Ooh oh oh

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Yeah, I lost my father to the bottle
Functioning alcoholics what they call it far as I know
Became a teenager and started to understand
But even through drinks he still taught me to be a man
So before the hospital, where the paramedics rushed him
He knew that everybody who met him, instantly loved him
I run the con concerts? Would have made him even sicker
Cause who gon' tell him he can't drink none of his son's liquor
And tell me without my father how am I supposed to manage?
He had the biggest heart, but also had that liver damage
Tell me what's the cure for a man who miss his paps
The beat goes on, but the drinking' gotta stop

[Hook]

[Bridge: Monica]
Not a day goes by that I don't miss ya, and don't wish you were here with me
No matter what you did, I forgive you

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I lost my father to the bottle
Tell your parents you love 'em
You might not see them tomorrow
I swallow my pride, try to put my problems aside
But I feel so hollow inside
Gotta keep my eyes on the prize
Cause I'm steady wishing you were here
To see the goals that I plan to reach
You left the day after I put you into my Grammy speech
It's almost like you waited just to see me win
Well, pops I can't wait until the day we meet again

[Hook]

[Outro: Monica]
I can't get over you you you, hey
Love in a bottle, hey heyy
Oh, I miss you
I wanna see you tomorrow
I wanna see you again
I wanna see you tomorrow
I miss you, you you you you
I love you, you you you",aprox,200,Ocean Skies (Feat. Monica)

One million bottlebags count 'em
Think they can bounce the ounce
And it get 'em
Yo black spend 288 million
Sittin' there waitin' for the fizz
And don't know what the fuck it is
An oh lemme tell you 'bout shorty
He about seventeen lookin' like 40
Treats his 40 dog better than his g
When he gets a big b-o-t-t-l-e
Oh he loves tha liquor
But look watch shorty get sicker
Year after year
While he's thinkin' it's beer
But it's not but he got it in his gut
So what the fuck
Yo niga what's up
Now he's hostile to a brother lookin' out
But I ain't mad I know what he about
He's just a slave to the bottle and the can
'Cause that's his man
The malt liquor man
One million bags count 'em all
Other man gets happy
Watch the killas drink 8 ball
Don't know a damn thing
But his breath stinkin'
Then I ask a question you brother
What the fuck is you drinkin'
He don't know but it flow
Out the bottle in a cup
He call it gettin' fucked up
Like we ain't fucked up already
See the man they call Crazy Eddie
Liquor man with the bottle in his hand
He give the liquor man ten to begin
Wit' no change and he run
To get his brains rearranged
Serve it to the home they're able
To do without a table
Beside what's inside ain't on the label
They drink it thinkin' it's good
But they don't sell the shit in the white neighborhood
Exposin' the plan they get mad at me I understand
They're slaves to the liquor man
Back to my homeboy shorty
He can drink it down
And think nuttin' about it
Pass it around and get tha 40 dog buzz
At the same time
Shorty can't remember what day it was
Say I'm yellin' is fact
Genocide kickin' in yo back
How many times have you seen
A black fight a black
After drinkin' down a bottle
Or a malt liquor six-pack
Malt liquor bull
What it is is bullshit Colt
45 another gun to the brain
Who's sellin' us pain
In the hood another up to no good
Plan that's designed by the other man
But who drink it like water
One and on till the stores reorder it
Brothers cry broke but they still affordin' it
Sippin' it lick drink it down oh nooo
Drinkin' poison but they don't know
It used to be wine
A dollar and a dime
Same man, drink in another time
They could be hard as hell and don't give a damn
But still be a sucker to the liquor man

I'd rather live a wrong doing life

It's a downright disgrace

I'll see you when I can

Am I wrong to fall so deeply in love with you
Knowing I got a wife and two little children
Depending on me too
And am I wrong to hunger
for the gentleness of your touch
knowing I got somebody else at home
who needs me just as much

And are you wrong to fall in love
With a married man
And am I wrong trying to hold on
To the best thing I ever had

But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you

Just hold on and I'll find you

I'm hanging on by a thread
And all I'm clinging to is prayers
And every breath is like a battle
I feel like I ain't come prepared
And death's knocking on the front door
Pain is creeping through the back
Fear is crawling through the windows
Waiting for 'em to attack
They say don't get bitter, get better
I'm working on switching them letters
But tell God
I'mma need a whole lot of hope
keeping it together
I'm smilin' in everyone's face

They don't understand what I'm going through

I say pain strengthens
And fear drives faith
And I don't know all of the outcomes
Don't know what happens tomorrow
But when that ocean of doubt comes
Don't let me drown in my sorrow
And don't let me stay at the bottom
I feel like this hole is too deep to climb
I've been looking for a way out
But I'll settle for a peace of mind
Picking up the pieces of my life
and hoping that I put together something right
Tell me all I got is all I need
Tell me you gon' help me stand and fight

""The time spent writing about the intensity involved in trying to 
keep love together is short; but the endless research can kill you."" 
There are oceans of feelings between us 
Currents that take us and sweep us away 
That's why we seldom have seen us 
In the light of a cold hard day 

Lots of new friends with the same old answers 
Open your eyes 
You might see 
If our lives were that simple 
We'd live in the past 
If the phone doesn't ring 
It's me 

If the phone doesn't ring 
You'll know that it's me 
I'll be out in the eye of the storm 
If the phone doesn't ring 
You know that I'll be 
Where someone can make me feel warm 

It's too bad we can't turn 
And live in the past 
If the phone doesn't ring 
It's me 

I've had good days and bad days 
And goin' half mad days 
I try to let go but you're still on my mind 
I've lost all the old ways 
I'm searchin' for new plays 
Puttin' it all on the line 

Lots of new friends with the same old problems 
Open your eyes you might see 
If our lives were that simple 
We'd live in the past 
If the phone doesn't ring

If the phone doesn't ring

It's me, it's me 
It's me, it's me

Pick up on one and leave the other one behind
It's not often easy, and not often kind
Did you ever have to make up your mind?

Did you ever have to finally decide?
Say yes to one and let the other one ride
There's so many changes, and tears you must hide
Did you ever have to finally decide?

Sometimes there's one with deep blue eyes, cute as a bunny
With hair down to here, and plenty of money
And just when you think she's that one in the world
Your heart gets stolen by some mousy little girl
And then you know you better make up your mind
Pick up on one and leave the other one behind
It's not often easy, and not often kind
Did you ever have to make up your mind?

Sometimes you really dig a girl the moment you kiss her
And then you get distracted by her older sister
When in walks her father and takes you in line
And says ""Better go home, son, and make up your mind.""
Then you bet you'd better finally decide!
And say yes to one and let the other one ride
There's so many changes, and tears you must hide
Did you ever have to finally decide?

What's free?
Free is when nobody else could tell us what to be
Free is when the Tv ain't controllin' what we see
Told my niggas: I need you
Through all the fame, you know I stayed true
Pray my niggas stay free
Made a few mistakes, but this ain't where I wanna be

Been a top dog, that's before the K-Dots
Crackin' in '06, Immaculate showmanship
Talkin' like you Mitch, disastrous on the strip
Holdin' on your bitch, coulda never sold you a brick
With them people, you never been on a list
Mona Lisa to me ain't nothin' but a bitch
Hangin' pictures like niggas swingin' from his dick
We so different, you thought these didn't exist
The Megalodon never seen on his wrist
I'm from the South where they never make it this rich
God is the greatest, but Satan been on his shit
Walkin' the pavement, I pray I'm illuminated
Over a decade and never nobody's favorite
Pot and kilo go hand in hand like we Gamble and Huff
My amigo, a million grams and we count 'em and up
You was dead broke, I let you hold a pack
You paid for it, but I fucked around and stole the track

Lookin' for a bond, lawyers wanna tax
Purple hair got them faggots on your back

Somethin's burnin', I can't figure out what
It's either lust or a cloud of dust
Judgement is clouded
Must just be the powder from the power of love
But I'm in somethin' I don't know how to get out of
Left my girl in the house alone
Is that my soon to be spouse's moan
And the further I walked allowed her
I paused for a minute to make something, that's what I heard
Cuz after all this is her place
So I gave her the benefit of the doubt
Think I might be about busta busta
The thought's so scary, yo that it hurts, brace
Hope it ain't, there we go, yo
Cause my head already goes to worst case scenario
Though, in the first place
But you confirmed my low end theory, though
Should've known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date
Coulda made it to home plate
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face first
No, you don't, under, stand, I, don't, do this for
Anyone, ever, yeah that ain't what they all say
I'll say it, you can suck a softball through a straw
Used to be my fiance
'til you sucked on wayne, andre, and kanye

I told that bitch
I'm a sucker for love, you're a sucker for dick
Suckin' dick in your momma's tub 'til your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water, he drowned
Like abortion, they booked you for manslaughter
You beat the case and I called you
""sherane is not available but leave a message at the tone
And kendrick don't forget to buy two pair of those
Expensive heels, you fuckin' little ferris wheel
Fuckin' spendin' on me, fuck you
Think we gon' get married still?
Fuckin' mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale

Like you should fuckin' beat it and fuckin' eat it

Bitch you serious? I'm in the mirror
With this look on my face, curious
Why you ain't fuckin' with me, you cut me up, a caesarean
You know I want you bad as a benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad
As the head shattered on george zimmerman
After the dillinger hit'em diligently and killin' him
His mouthpiece for a cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for yah
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore yah
This is me talkin' poetry, yeah I got some home trainin'
That ain't what you like, ain't it? what about if I was famous
As marshall, would you give fellatio in the carpool
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle, singin'

[verse 3: eminem]
So needless to say I'm feeling betrayed
Snatched my housekey off my keychain
She jumped off, wee-bay from the wire, escape
Now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record, cliche, it's all my fault anyway
She's turnin' the tables, I'm a beat-break
Treats my face like seratos, she cuts and scratches like a dj
Each day is an instant replay
They sayin' we display cinethematic abatic behavior
Back together but forgot today was her b-day
Cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstandin'
But just as I went to slam on the brakes
Then I realized that she may be as crazy as me, wait
Bitch cut my fuckin' brakeline
Stepped on them fuckers 8 times
Still goin' 73, thank god there's an exit coming up
But them other f-u-c-k's all would of hit the off ramp
So I coast into a gosh damned aww hit a fuckin' tree
Now here she comes at full speed
She's racin' at me, okay you wanna fuck with me, eh?
Snatch the bitch out her car through the window
She screamin'
I bodyslam her onto the cement
Until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
Bury this stink ho in it, then payed
To have the street re-paved
Fuck, woke up in a dream state in a cold sweat
Like I got hit with a freeze ray durin' a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though
Cause she's layin' next to me in bed
Directly aimin' a gat at my head
Woke up again and jumped up like fuck it
I've had it, I'm checkin' into rehab
I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy
Every girl I've ever had either says I got to much baggage
Or I'm just too dramatic
Man what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fucking romantic
I fucking love you, you fucking bitch!
Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction, a tragic event
I said ""hit the road"" and after she left
I sent I sent a barrage of texts
I said ""be careful driving, don't read this
And have a accident""
She glanced to look at it and write right, too bad
Thought we had a connect
No sense dwelling makes
Never been a more compelling case
Than a model covered in l'oreal and mace
Who fell from grace
Eleven stories for story telling
But the whore was yelling ""rape""
So the vocal cords were swelling and her voice
Were more hoarser than tori spelling's face
Still they swarm the gates and my fans making stakes
To greet norman bates with a warm embrace
Unless you're andrea yates
Don't ask me for a date, don't be late
Well the sentiments great
But wait then there's been a mistake
You want an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly because of the game of

First got it when he was six
Didn't know any tricks
Matter of fact first time he got on it he slipped
Landed on his hip
And bust his lip
For a week he had to talk with a lisp
Like THISSSSS
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didn't quit there was something in the air
Yea, he said it was something so appealing
He couldn't fight the feeling
Something about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it
Couldn't understand it
Brand it, just the first kickflip he land it
Uh, labeled a misfit, a bandit
Kakunk Kakunk Kakunk!
His neighbors couldn't stand it so
He was banished to the park
Started in the morning wouldn't stop 'til after dark

...so I'm sorry young man there's no skating here""

And away he rolled

So come and skate with me

So let's kick...and push...and coast

My man got a little older
Became a better roller
Yea, no helmet, hellbent on killing himself
That's what his mama said, but he was feeling himself
Got a little more swagger in his style
Met his girlfriend she was clapping in the crowd
Love is what what was happening to him now
Uh, he said I would marry you
But I'm engaged to these arials and variels
And I don't think this board is strong enough to carry two
She said Bow, I weigh 120 pounds
Now, let me make one thing clear
I don't need to ride yours
I got mine right here

That wasn't no punk
And they spitfire shirts
And SB dunks

In a dice game or go see her

Pay the bill on my beeper
Just so she can pay to put a 69
And I know what time to go freak her
Then one day I just asked her
Why you always getting your ass up?

I mean damn me and Hov get paid
All you do is get laid
This shit don't add up

even if I know it's not real love
Even if I know a nigga only finna hit it 
and then never call back, I still fuck""

Because she's so trill
I need some, she go still

Nigga guess where we go chill?
About four years she here though
My four pounds till' it goes down
I remember shawty, she stayed down
But I won't say her name
She married now

And I'm in my bed

She would always make moves like a boss do
And she never gave any nigga the time of day
But she the chick all these niggas tried to talk to
But when it came to me, she had a thing for me
When we kick it she roll up the weed for me
And we'd both cut class post up in the cut steady 
watching to see if the police coming
We got close overtime, her and I
Right around the time that I first got signed
Come to think about it I was 'bout 17
Didn't have a licence, couldn't even drive
I was going back and forth from these flights

She became so suspicious of these other bitches
She'd go through my phone and we'd fight

Talk about torn between the two
Wasn't much more that we could do
There wasn't much base for us
But she stayed down with every tour she seen me do
But I guess one night I had a few, huh one night I had a few
Yeah, this one chick that caught my eye
I told her ""hurry up, meet me at the room""
And no, I didn't have a contraceptive
My common sense, neglected
And two months later next thing 
I know I got a text that said ""I'm pregnant""
And you can almost bet she kept it
That's the reason why you left me
On top of all that
It wasn't even mine, I went and got fraternity tested

Wait, hold up, is that you?
With them big ol' thighs after school?
J305 and gave me high five when I say i'm in high pursuit
You say I won't drive till kendrick drive
A new montecarlo that cruise
And that shot my pride try to improv
But no freestyle I never knew
You looking for the nigga with the tallest fetti
You over looking at every nigga that ain't quite ready
To make it rain on you like you bout to break a levy
Hold up, that pussy petty
Yeah your nails did your hair did
Your cell phone is selfish
It only got numbers that come with a home
A new pre madonna I smelt it
Tried to make you my ho
Tried to make some time ho
But I ain't got the time or the patience to stop and wait in line ho
Her dreams holds versace she fall for armani
She only deal with rich niggas
Fuck you and mitt romney
I'm grown now i'm on my own now
I'm po-o-o-oppin' change my phone now
When I get home now I got o-o-o-options

Your eyes were full of spite.
I was desperate, I was weak
I could not put up a fight.

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?

You were strangely less than pain
Than you were cold.
Triumphant in your mind
Of the logic that you hold.

You said no one would ever know
The love that we had shared.
As I took my leave to go
It was clear that you didn't care.

And I hear of your coming and your going in the town.
I hear stories of your smile,
I hear stories of your frown.

We can relish all the pain.

Cause you know I love the same.

And you know

I met her down at Aldean's
She said she that saw me walkin' in about a mile away
Bean just had to take her phone and that just took her smile away
She said I'm too drunk and crazy, she don't like the way I dance
I said, ""you don't have to join in, "" she said she'd take a chance
I've been kinda crazy ever since it went down
I get kind of lost, and, baby, this what I found

I went to the bar to go buy her a drink
She listen to P! nk, she told me she not into rap
I can't run out of money

Automatic joy

Many shapes and weights to choose from
I will never leave my bedroom
I will never cry at night again
Wrap my arms around him and pretend

Cannot hold a candle to my new boy and I'll
Never let him go and I'll never be alone
Not with my coin operated boy

With my sad picture of girl getting bitterer
Can you extract me from my plastic fantasy?
I didn't think so, but I'm still convincible
Will you persist ever after I bet you
A billion dollars that I'll never love you?
Will you persist even after I kiss you
Goodbye for the last time?
Will you keep on trying to prove it?
I'm dying to lose it, I'm losing
I want it
I want you
I want a coin operated boy

And if I had a star to wish on
For my life I can imagine
Any flesh and blood could be his match
I can even take him in the bath

But I know he feels like a boy should feel

5875,5875,Songs about change,Yes We Can,will.i.am,"It was a creed written into the founding documents
that declared the destiny of a nation. 
Yes we can. 

It was whispered by slaves and abolitionists
as they blazed a trail toward freedom. 
Yes we can. Yes we can.

It was sung by immigrants
as they struck out from distant shores and pioneers
who pushed westward against an unforgiving wilderness. 
Oh, yes we can. 

It was the call of workers who organized;
women who reached for the ballots;
a President who chose the moon as our new frontier;
and a King who took us to the mountaintop
and pointed the way to the Promised Land. 
Yes we can to justice and equality. 

Yes we can to opportunity and prosperity. 
Yes we can to opportunity and prosperity.
Yes we can heal this nation. 
Yes we can repair this world. 
Yes we can. 

We know the battle ahead will be long,
but always remember that no matter what obstacles stand in our way,
nothing can stand in the way of the power of millions of voices calling for change.
(We want change.)

We have been told we cannot do this by a chorus of cynics.
they will only grow louder and more dissonant.
We’ve been asked to pause for a reality check.
We’ve been warned against offering the people of this nation false hope. 
But in the unlikely story that is America,
there has never been anything false about hope. 

Now the hopes of the little girl who goes to a crumbling school in Dillon
are the same as the dreams of the boy who learns on the streets of LA;
we will remember that there is something happening in America;
that we are not as divided as our politics suggests;
that we are one people; we are one nation;
and together, we will begin the next great chapter in the American story
with three words that will ring from coast to coast;
from sea to shining sea: Yes We Can.",aprox,200,Yes We Can (barack Obama Song)

you're all sick of all these crap rappers
Bitin' their rhymes because um they're back-stabbers
But when it comes to me and my friend Doug Fresh here
There is no competition 'cause we are the best, yeah
But let's impress which we prove
And ya all will realize that we are the move

Just to see ya smile and enjoy yourself
'Cause it's cool when ya cause a cozy conditioning
That we create, 'cause that's our mission
So listen to what we say
Because this type of shit, it happens everyday
I woke up around ten o' clock in the mornin'
I gave myself a stretch up, a mornin' yawnin'
Went to the bathroom to wash up
Had some soap on my face and my hand up on a cup
I said, um, mirror mirror on the wall
Who is the top choice of them all
There was a rubble dubble, five minutes it lasted
The mirror said you are you conceited bastard

Well that's true, thats why we never have no beef
So then I washed off the soap and brushed the gold teeth
Used Oil Of Olay 'cause my skin gets pale
And then I got the files for my fingernails
Chewed through the night and on my behalf
I put the bubbles in the tub so I could have a bubble bath
Clean, dry was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new Gucci underwear
For all the girls I might take home
I got the Johnson's Baby Powder and the Polo cologne
Fresh dressed like a million bucks
Threw on the bally shoes and the fly green socks
Stepped out my house stopped short, oh no
I went back in, I forgot my kangol
And then I dilly (dallied)
I ran though a (alley)
I bumped into my homegirl (Sally)
>From the (valley)
This is the girl plays hard to get so I said
Whats wrong 'cause she looked upset, she said
It's all because of you I'm feelin' sad and blue
You went away and now my life is filled with rainy days
I love you so, how much you'll never know
'Cause you took your love away from me
Now what was I to do, she's cryin' over me
And she was feelin' blue
I said, um, don't cry, dry your eye
Here comes your mother with those two little guys
Her mean mother stepped up, said to me hi
Looked Sally in the face and decked her in the eye
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
Slammed the child on the hard concrete
The bitch was strong, the kids was gone
Something was wrong, I said what is goin' on
I tried to break it up, I said stop it, leave her
She said, if I can't have you, she can't either
She grabbed me closely by my socks
So I broke the hell out like I had the chicken pox, but
She gave chase; she caught up quick
She put a finger in the face of MC Rick
She said why don't you give me a play
So we can go cruisin' in my oj
And if you give me that OK
I'll give you all my love today
Ricky, Ricky, Ricky, can't you see
Somehow your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your jazzy ways, oh
MC Rick my love is here to stay
And on and on and on she kept on
The bitch been around before my mother's born
I said cheer up, I gave her a kiss
I said you can't have me, I'm too young for you miss
She says no you're not, then she starts cryin'
I says I'm nineteen, she said stop lyin'
I says I am, go ask my mother
And with your wrinkled pussy, I can't be your lover

Woke up, blamed it on the vodka
I genuinely thought i was dying,
Then i could see that smile you were hiding

Last night i told you i need ya,
Thats the last time i drink tequila,
Sucking lemon and the psychic sulking
I start crying and verbally assaulting

Last night i asked you to merry me,
Thats when i remember the brandy!
I wake up and claim i didn't say it,
Screwed if i ever wake up in vegas

Wish i could stop, and i'm not joking!
Driking too much and socially smoking
Wish i could stop, start to behave and
Wake up in the morning and never miss a day again

Last night, police had to frisk me.
In the cells thanks to Bell's fine whiskey.
I think I said too much, “Like, do you like my bracelets?
Oh wait, they're handcuffs.”

Last night I said I want your babies.
Forget the ice, it's not nice to drink Bailey's. Yuuch.
I drink that much that I forget.
Whatever embarrassing thing I say next.

You said I got on one knee, and there's no way…
Unless I've been drinking, oh wait, Rose!
Sailor Jerry's Rum I think I drank me a ship full.
Please, please, someone provide me a dis' bro.

Last night I called you a loser.
I think that was after flaming Sambuca.
I shouted at you, “Do me a favor.”
And that's when, I fell off the pavement.

Wish I could stop and I'm not joking.
Drinking too much and socially smoking.
Wish I could stop, and start to behave and then
Wake up in the morning and never miss a day again.

Cause I'd love to learn when to shut my mouth.
Wake up in the morning and be in my own house.
Do one last shot, I'd know when to stop.
No more photos on Facebook of me doing the robot.

Know when to leave and when to lock my front door.
Stop waking up in cheese and in a bed full of people.
Sitting in a cupboard with by weird best friend.
But I'm only young so I'm not going to pretend.
I wish I…

Wish I could stop and I'm not joking.

And who I used to be
Is still a part of me

An early morning, cold December, a family gathered all around
Taken back what I was given, open grave site, frozen ground
I see my hands, they are my father's, time has worn my fingers thin
Humor, laughter, ever after, my heart still remembers him

As long as you've got hope, you'll find your way
There's power in the thoughts that you think
There's power in the words you say

Like I can, I can, I will, I will

Today, I saw a rainbow in the rain
It told me I can do anything
If I believe, I believe, I believe in me
I believe, I believe, I believe in me
Ooh, yeah
Ooh

I got the light, inside of me
And I've got no choice, but to let it breathe
As long as there is love, I can make it anywhere I go
If I follow my dreams
I'll end up building a yellow brick road

Like I can, I can, I will, I will
I am, I am, no fear, no fear

Living my best life
I am wearing a crown that's only fit for a queen

And it wasn't overnight

Last time running never went too well
Heart saying carry on, head telling me forfeit
Glimpse of the high life, I wish I never saw this
Now I want it all, want it all, I'm selfish

Felt locked down like I caught a death sentence
Like Alan Sugar fired me from The Apprentice
See my little weight, I must've lost half
Even Nando's
Won't send me a new black card

And there's all opinions and assumptions
Back to the grind and there's more where it comes from
I love the life 'cause my life flash cameras on
Tell Cheryl Cole and Rihanna that I love them

From young I've been obsessed with the fame
Know you're in lane
'Cause your dreams were the same
Every day I pray, really wishing for a change
Dreams to reality and now I'm in the game

Flash lights and the good life, keep calling out my name
And I pray somehow something's gonna change
Bright lights in the skyline won't let me lose my way
'Cause I know somehow something's gonna change

Tell me how you feel
Do you love me or hate me, there's no pleasing everybody
Need to focus, then he lost track, I'm really sorry
Left the black clouds, bright lights got me feeling jolly
Never let you down, that's my word
You ain't gotta worry

Work for this, don't know about you but I work for this
Couple labels said I wasn't worth the risk
Just another hoodrat hoodie with a black hat
He's just one of them looking for a purse to nick

Never really had a plan B
Stayed on point, I am sharper than a Stanley
Big star, flash car, looking trendy
I know it's time to?

From young I've been obsessed with the fame
Know you're in lane
'Cause your dreams were the same
Every day I pray, really wishing for a change
Dreams to reality and now I'm in the game

Flash lights and the good life, keep calling out my name
And I pray somehow something's gonna change
Bright lights in the skyline won't let me lose me way
'Cause I know somehow something's gonna change

Let me tell you when to take it down
This is the part where the song breaks down
Stay looking up, never facing down
Long as the bright lights are blazing down

Flash lights and the good life, keep calling out my name

Bright lights in the skyline won't let me lose me way

I come into this life
The song of a woman
And a man who lived in strife
He was tired of being poor
And he wasn't into selling door to door
And he worked like the devil to be more

A different kind of poverty now upsets my soul
Night after sleepless night
I walk the floor and I want to know
Why am I so alone?
Where is my woman can I bring her home?
Have I driven her away?
Is she gone?

Morning comes to sunrise
And I'm driven to my bed
I see that it is empty
And there's devils in my head
I embrace the many colored beast
I grow weary of the torment
Can there be no peace?
And I find myself just wishing that my life would simply cease.",aprox,200,4+20

It's you and I,
God has made us fall in love, it's true,
I've really found someone like you,

Will it say the love you feel for me, will it say,
That you will be by my side
To see me through,
Until my life is through,

Well, in my mind, we can conquer the world,
In love you and I, you and I, you and I,

I am glad at least in my life I found someone
That may not be here forever to see me through,
But I found strength in you,
I only pray that I have shown you a brighter day,
Because that's all that I am living for, you see,
Don't worry what happens to me.

Cause' in my mind, you will stay here always,

Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls, these castle walls
If I should tumble, if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls?
There's no one here at all, behind these castle walls

[T.I. - Verso 1]

Observing the estate through the gate from the outside looking in
Bet you think I got it made, better look again
I got a butler, got a maid, and a mansion
The belief is that I'm living out a millionaire's fantasy
With Phantoms e Ferrari's in the driveway
But you see the pain and the change of the sane man's sanity
Your vision jaded by the Grammy's on the mantelpiece
Just switch your camera lenses you would see the agony
Apparently it's damaging the man you see before you
On the canvas he may seem alright but all the disadvantages
His family encounters overshadows his extravagance
Walk in my lines while I dare you with a stare at you 
While it surelly seem like the King's life ain't glamorous
As seen through the eyes of untrained amateurs
Because the cameras doesn't see beyond the walls of the smiles
Only counts until it falls in the pile

[Christina Aguilera]

Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls (these castle walls)
If I should tumble, if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls?
There's no one here at all, behind these castle walls

[T.I. - Verso 2]

Honestly to me, I think I'd lose every benefit of all that I've accomplished
If my key is never with it, shit me knowing this
Why should the verses I have laid 
Be more important to me than the persons I have raised?
I guess I'm saying that to say that oppotunity 
But they just don't equate to all the time they take away 
From the kids all the shit I did right is a mistake
If Deyjah end up a stripper and Major slinging Yay
How could I ever consider myself a great
If Messiah ain't paied and ‘Nique'Nique ain't straight
Would your favorite song about the whips, money and shit 
Be relevant If you found out the money wasn't real, nope
So me being the GOAT shouldn't mean 
More to me than see it to a king though
From a bad ass kid to a man with some dough
Otherwise I may well have stayed poor
So while they stay focused on me beefing with Flip, 
Shawty Low, with Gucci or Ludacris
Or if I'm fucking with a hoe, 
Did I snitch when I got arrested or will I die over nonsense
Internally I'm dealing with this conflict
So excuse me if I don't get the chance to kiss the hand 
Or slap me in the face, hey, I'm just the man
If they saying I ain't the best in making hit records
It's 'cause this is my life, this ain't just rapping 
Didn't think it all it was that deep, did ya dawg
See you can't see the castle through the walls till it falls
Didn't think it all it was that deep, did ya dawg
See you can't see the castle through the walls till it falls

Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls (these castle walls)
If I should tumble, if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls?
There's no one here at all, behind these castle walls

Nobody knows I'm all alone
Living in this castle made of stone
They say that money is freedom but I feel trapped inside it all

And while I sit so high up on a throne
I wonder how I can feel this low
On top of the world it's beautiful
But there's no place to fall

[T.I. - Verso 3]

For the record ay, I give a damn if I never said shit again
My career was meant for me to come and tell it
Honest interpretation of how affected I'm faced
With matters most rappers used to keep locked away in the basement
The day that I walk away I ain't saying that I'm amazing
Downplaying the way I keep fellas from catching cases
Won't take into consideration how much it mean what I'm saying
And when I say what I mean even when I'm surrounded by the fakers
From one of the greatest centers, blessed with most of God's graces
Who made his way amongst the greatest from the grimiest places
So next time you rating royalty
I'm always being given to recordings than the level of your loyalty 
(Hmm)
Obviously you've been ignoring me
Who else ya seen make it through the storm, unharmed disjointed
While all the critics was looking for Prince charming
Disregarded the king of the south raised doubt
Even tho he made a castle out of what used to be a house
He did shit that all your favorite rappers only rap about
But most of ya'll don't see the castle through the walls
And the smiles till it fall in piles so while

As my world turns, the heart beats
Not only in my chest, but the heart in the streets
So when they feel this, they feel me
But I can't feel nothin', outside these Dre beats
I am from the city of people, came from the bottom
Standing on top of what was supposed to be my coffin, what's up?
Except for shows, we are the dead man walkin'
But reflections show this kid's still got it
Better be known I got the throne like 
I don't know that there's a king
Never grew up around a family because I'm not a human being
And anyone under my bubble that's coming in my spot, for the top
Let 'em have it, 'cause when I leave, the whole world drops

And pull on my black coat and my black chucks 
And nothing in my jeans
It's just one, til the day come like Rocky's movie scene
The day I'm on top of the world, 
Look up the screen like this is me, this is Kells
Crucified by the public without the nails
Do or die in my city
But clearly I never failed
Lost myself from the game when I found myself from the cell
And I found myself from the fame when I lost myself in the pills
And you cannot mess with me still,

Man, I swear to God it get so deep though
That sometimes I just gotta wake my ass up
out my sleep though
And wonder what if all the shit I reaped then got repoed
And the girl I gave it all up for ain't love me for me though
See, I got a stack of problems
that could use a fucking steamroll
Got off in the game, don't need no cheat code
As long as I know the G code
Being paranoid done turned me to a creep
You ain't got that metal on your side
Police gon' work it like Magneto if they need to
it get deep
Deep, deeper than telekinesis
Deeper than your sister dying
and you're telling your nieces
The deeper it gets, boy, the pressure increases
But pressure make diamonds
And my name is Sean cause I shine, it's self explanatory
I architect the flow, rapping all of these stories on stories
You know the story
If my back against the ropes, then I'll finish Stone Cold it

You fuck with the best rapper, don't even know it

but it's cool cause I never give an inch
And I don't give two fucks about what your mouth say
Cause this shit is deeper than rap, I cannot say
That shit enough times like somebody rewind me
Like shit is deeper than rap
I cannot say that shit enough times

Is it because he ain't got the tattoos?
He ain't throwing up signs
Well, let me throw up mine
And also let me show this vision of mine

And if getting your point across crosses the line
Some of the time then cross it with pride
That's real, my nigga, remember that
And it ain't about if they remember you
they remember rap

Figuring which club he'll sneak in
Fancy drinks and 50 dollar cover charge
Lately it's been a big hassle
Heineken and New Castle
To make sure he's fitting in and living large

Disregard the lies that he will tell
And what he's probably like
'Cause it's not hard, his charm is gonna
Get him through the night

'Cause if he wanna rock, he rocks
If he wanna roll, he rolls
He can roll with the punches
Long as he feels like he's in control

If he wanna stay, he stays
If he wanna go, he goes
He doesn't care how he gets there
Long as he gets somewhere he knows
Oh, no

See her, heavy make up and cut t-shirt
Every girl out wants to be her
But they look the same already, why adjust?
Reading the magazine secrets
Forgetting the topical regrets
'Cause if she comes I'm all alone and night's a bust

It's a must the swivel in her hips
And the look she gives
It's all her trust if only in the morning
She knew where she lived

'Cause if she wanna rock, she rocks

And if she wanna stay, she stays
If she wanna go, she goes
She doesn't care how she gets there
Long as she gets somewhere she knows
Oh, no

And in a wink they're on the brink
From drinks to drink and at the bar
With cash to blow
Shot to shot it's getting hot
Advance the plot to see how far it's gonna go

All depends so ditch the friends and grab a cab
Another chance for cheap romance
Doesn't count 'cause the room is spinning
Nothing to lose tonight they both are winning
And they fall in love as they fall in bed, they sing

If they wanna rock, they rock
If they wanna roll, they roll
They can roll with the punches

And if they wanna stay, they stay
If they wanna go, they go

Ace in my hand and a 45 tuck
Money coming down codeine pourin up
Smokin on some dope, always on a float
20 years in niggas callin me the G. O. A. T
Money adding up you haters going broke
Still in the game while you niggas ridin' oak
See me showin out they muggin I dont give a fuck

Grandma would kiss my face
Wish I could go back there again
I'd climb up in my Grandpa's lap
I'd lay down and take a nap
That old man and me were best friends

And one day I turned around
Leaves are fallin', fallin' down
Those fields were bare and brown
And they were gone

Long gone like bluebonnets in the spring
We're only here for a little while
It's beautiful and bittersweet
So make the most of every mile
So pack like and love heavy
Give it all your heart and soul
So in the end you won't regret one thing
Life is like bluebonnets in the spring

There's so much I can't explain
Such as gravity and pain
Still I remain, blindfolded and full of faith
I kissed my angel girl goodbye
Still can't help but wonder why
But I believe I'll see her again someday

So, hold 'em tender, hold 'em tight
Pray every mornin', day, and night
That God will help you raise them right
And don't you blink, don't blink

'Cause like bluebonnets in the spring
We're only here for a little while
It's beautiful and bittersweet
So make the most of every mile
So pack light and love heavy
Give it all your heart and soul
So in the end you won't regret one thing

Life can be filled full of sorrow
Time is something you can't borrow
So love like there's no tomorrow
Because today could the day

Ooh, it's hard to get up out of bed
When everything is on its head
And nothing seems to make any sense
Like a band-aid on a bleeding heart
I fake a smile and fall apart
And no one ever knows I'm a wreck

Backed in a corner, uncomfortably numb
Watching myself become a shadow of someone
Oh, it's hard to find a place to hide
When you're running from what's inside
No matter where you go, there you are
So tonight I'll go to war with me

And I was angry for a long long time

Can I borrow just a little cup of kindness

What would you do or think of me?
Would you trust me?

But you feedin' me, All this rap about,
How it's different
But it's not mentioned what you're doin' is wicked.
Now I'm having, second thoughts about,
You and me, cuz this is not how I want it or it should be.

You say you want my trust and
Told me you were leavin'.
How am I to know that you won't do it to me?
You're tellin' me it's different
But what the hell is different
If you cheated on him you'll do it to me.

You're creepin' on him for me,
But you say just trust me.
How am I to know that you won't do it to me?
You're tellin' me it's different
But what the hell is different

And what goes around comes back around
Till you find out it's harder
And I'm pretty sure,
That he's thinkin'
That you're totally his, but you're here in my room
Don't cha'll talk wit me
All hugged up,
And all over me
Kissin' all of me
Is that to get me where you want me to be?
Don't want this
To happen to me.
So I'll drop you off, go back to your man
Cuz really, this ain't me.

7092,7092,Songs about confidence or courage,Only The Strong,Flaw,"What makes me think that it'll all work out in the end
Afraid to feel bad, better off to try and pretend
I'm immortal, immune to all that is wrong
Just keep on wishing, crossing my fingers so long
Is this helping, I'm growing weaker each day
Can't stop whining, still afraid of what I might say
Or reactions, that control us one and all
It's mine, it's pure and, as decent as I can make myself
Inside, we all know, only the strong survive
Why don't you think about that
So now I'm bleeding, on myself yes once again
Seems I trusted another deceitful friend, my
Fault should've known the deal
Keep your friends close, but your enemy's closer
for real
Seems easy, but nothing could be so hard
Trying to guess life's dealing what's the next card
I'm surely folding, I don't like this hand at all
(chorus)
Keep those eyes wide open, here comes a blind side
Maybe things happen for a reason, and wherein
lies the answer
To overcome the grieving, of life's unruly lessons
I'm handed in succession, it builds my pain which
makes me strong

Blue told me to remind you niggas
Fuck that shit y'all talk about
I'm the nigga, caught up in all these lights and cameras
But look what that shit did to Hammer
God-damnit it I like it
The bright lights is enticing
But look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night
30 mil for one fight
But soon as all the money blows
All the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheating on me
What I do, I took her back, fool me twice
That's my bad, I can't even blame her for that
Enough to make me wanna murder
Momma please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame

Photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk
See them by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off
Enough is enough
I'm calling this off
Who the fuck I'm kidding though?
I'm getting high
Sitting low
Sliding by
In that big body
Curtains all in my window
This fame hurt
But this chain works
I think back
You asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga deal with
It, this shit ain't work
This light work
Camera snapping, my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and Irs
Get the hell up off of your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for
Dry yours
Why you mad
Take the good with the bad
Don't throw that baby out with the bath water

Had a family

We are looking back again
On loneliness and pain
Never been so wide awake

Breath slowly in and out
Somewhere behind the clouds
I can see the mornin break

Too young to live a lie
Look into my eyes

Ready, set, go!
It's time to run
The sky is changing, we are one
Together we can make it
While the world is crashin' down
Don't you turn around

Leave it all behind you now
The final wall is breaking down
We are what it's all about
Nothin can stop us now

I promise you right now
I'll never let you down

Ready, set, go!
It's time to run
The sky is changing, we are one
Together we can make it
While the world is crashin' down
Don't you turn around

C5

[Chorus: XXTENTACION]
Don't cry, don't go
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you
Woah!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
You're staring into the clouds
Am I rising or they comin' down
I see death around the corner
And the U-turn sign's lookin' like a smile
What do I do now? Who gon' find me, how?
Nowhere to turn but around and round
Just another nigga that done lost his head
No, a fucking king that forgot his crown
I am not number one, it's true
I'm number 9-27-82
Color blind, even if I may be blue
A lot on my plate, ain't my favorite food
But I'm hungry, so hungry
Need my family tree next to a money tree
With a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden
With a bunch of Eves, no fruit punch for me
I sip from the fountain of youth
So if I die young, blame the juice
Bury me in New Orleans
Tombstone reads ""Don't cry, stay tuned""
Bring me back to life
Got to lose a life just to have a life
But if heaven's as good as advertised
I want a triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife
Rest in paradise

[Chorus: XXTENTACION & Lil Wayne]
Don't cry (don't cry, don't cry), don't go (why, oh why?)
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you
Don't cry (don't cry, don't cry, don't cry)
don't go (why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (don't cry, don't cry)
I fuckin' love you (don't cry, don't cry)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Talent is God-given, be grateful
Fame is not a given, be humble
And conceit is self-driven, drive carefully
Stay in your own lane, seat buckled
And sometimes when there is no music
We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum
That woman carried the future
And Tunechi was born like ""dun-dun-dun-dun""
Don't call it a comeback
It was dark, now the sun back
Hit me hard, but I punched back
The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap
Is it suicide or it's do or die
It's newer days and it's bluer skies
I told myself ""It's just you and I""
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who I'm there for
I give my last breath to effort
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew I'd find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Can't control the tears, let them drop and roll

[Chorus: XXTENTACION & Lil Wayne]
Don't cry (don't cry, don't cry)
don't go (why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (don't cry), I fuckin' love you
(triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife)
Don't cry (don't cry, don't cry)
don't go (why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you (don't cry)

Standing there
Young again
Long brown hair
As he crosses over
To the other side
She smiles at him
He runs at her
With arms open wide

She was his reason for living
She was his rock and his best friend
They'll be reunited in heaven
'Cause he's dying to see her again

He went down hill
Once she was gone
Lost the will, to carry on
They couldn't find nothing wrong
No matter what they did
But I know the answers in the picture frame that's sitting by his desk

She was his reason for living
She was his rock and his best friend
They'll be reunited in heaven
'Cause he's dying to see her again

As the doctors come running
I overhear a nurse say ""were loosin' him""
We've been losing him since he lost her

Ive been up for 4 days
Getting money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold spades
Rolexes, chauffeurs, and low fades
I keep thinking how young can you die from old age
The always tell me no one is working as hard as you
And even though I laugh it off man its probably true
Cuz while all of my closest friends out partying
Im just here making all the music that they party too
But party on, party on, all night n-gga
I got these new rappers nervous prom night n-gga
I grow tired of these f-cking grown man liars
Story tellers, they aint even need a camp fire
Uhh, but I just wanna tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
This sh-t feel like when fredro star was a sunset bar stunting hard in his yellow goose
Ya, and ima mothing f-cking missed target
But a target none the less, and I just started
Was that directed at Muahh?
Cant be, they must be talking to themselves Hov, hands free
Yeah, and im just filling up this daily planner
Getting busy cuz im a star, no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talking in their music
And I just say I wrote it for yo girlfriends Kelsey Grammar
Yah, that’s what life becomes when you doing you
Welcome to Hollywood don’t let this town ruin you
And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwing you
Just know that she gon tell another n-gga when she through with you
Don’t get impatient when it takes to long
And drink it all even when it taste too strong yeah
I get her feeling live even if it kills me
Promise to always give you me, the real me

Who would have thought
I’d be caught in this life?
Let’s celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
(Hey, Guru, tell hom’ to go to open that Ace right there),
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon’ make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down
I’m gon’ make this go

OWWWWWWW, Hov turning heads like OWELSSSSS
Im the man of the hour
Triple entendre don’t even ask me how

Bright lights will make your whole city light up
A trillion watt light bulb when im in the night club
I just landed in that G-450, caught the mayweather fight cuz his satellite was crispy
Uhh, yall can miss me with the money talk
The smart moneys on Hov, f-ck what the dummys talk
I don’t do to much blogging, I just run the town, I don’t do to much jogging
I aint gotta scar yet, you f-cking round with me and my dogs is far fetched
Drake, heres how they gon come at you
With silly rap feuds trying to distract you
In disguise in the form of a favor
The Barzini meeting, watch for the traitors
Uhh, and ive seen it all done it all
That’s why none of these dum dums could done him off
The summers ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that’s what winners do
And to these n-ggas im like windows 7
You let em tell it they swear that they invented you

Oh, Hail Marys
Friday nights
Heartbeat baby
Low-beam lights
God, I miss when you were mine

Back when that song was a song
I could sing along 
without thinkin bout you every time it came on
Every beat, every line, every word, every time
When a road was a road
I could roll on through without wishin that empty seat was you
Money was gas, dreams were dust
Love was fast and we were us

Shotgun sunset
A cool mint kiss
Backseat promise
Breaking it
Floorboard feeling
County lines
God, I miss when you were mine

Back when that song was a song
I could sing along 
without thinkin bout you every time it came on
Every beat, every line, every word, every time
When a road was a road
I could roll on through without wishin that empty seat was you
Money was gas, dreams were dust
Love was fast and we were us

In a sleepy town, just jumping in
Far too young to know that summers end
We were us, we can't go back
It's what it is, but God I miss

Back when that song was a song
I could sing along 
without thinkin bout you every time it came on
Every beat, every line, every word, every time
When a road was a road
I could roll on through without wishin that empty seat was you
Money was gas, dreams were dust
Love was fast and we were us

Every beat, every line, every word, every single time

The price of fame I think I paid, want my change I done gave
E'erything in my possession for my seconds on the stage
For my name up in lights and multi-million record sales
I done gave up my life, can't get a moment to myself
When alone I ask myself, is it worth it? I ain't perfect
Neither is anybody else, but I think my kids deserve
To be with Daddy out in public without all the interruptions
When the lies and gossip's published I'm the topic of discussion
And I stay in trouble just to show these suckers I ain't lost it
And I'd do it all again that's the funny thing about it
I ain't playing, boy I'm 'bout it
Will I change, boy I doubt it
I done been a lot of things, I ain't never been a coward

It's like 2Pac never died, sit back, enjoy the show
You see the shit that scares you senseless, I done lived through it
Knew the risks and the consequences and I still do it
And then I'm so fresh, them niggas mildew it
Not just a actor by profession, pimp, I live movies
That's why they whisper when they see me, point and stare at me
'Cause they just wanna live through me vicariously
Fashion weekend, Paris week, party like a rockstar
Get blown by a top model 'til she catch lockjaw
Got the dough you get a year, stashed in my sock drawer
Showed you the troubles and the struggles of an outlaw
Top dog would not fall, I am not y'all
Couple pages out the calendar and I'm out y'all

To when you can't see what's wrong from right
Well shorty 'til you walk a mile in my shoes

Life can be such a blur, obviously we prefer
Our privacy but instead we endure
Yes sir, don't expect nothin' less of me

Was bald darauf geschah.

Das gab mir wieder neuen Mut,
Und ich redete mir ein,
Mit Liebe wird alles gut.
Doch aus den Joints da wurden Trips,
Es gab keinen Halt auf der schiefen Bahn.
Die Leute fingen an zu reden,
Aber keiner bot
Conny Hilfe an.

Nun kann ich den Himmel seh'n.

Just a false start if you're quitting on us

you tired and you fell out of love
Maybe if you don't crash the landing

Ain't no tellin' what I'm finna be on
I'm beyond all that fuck shit

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Hey lil' mama, would you like to be my sunshine?
Nigga touch my gang we gon' turn this shit to Columbine
Ice on my neck cost me ten times three
Thirty thousand dollars for a nigga to get flee
I just hit Rodéo and I spent like ten Gs
I just did a show and spent the check on my mama
When I go on vacay I might rent out the Bahamas
And I keep like ten phones, damn I'm really never home
All these niggas clones tryna copy what I'm on
Nigga get your own, tryna pick a nigga bone
Word to brother Skip, boy I had a good day
Metro Pcs trappin' boy I'm making plays
Fifty shades of grey, beat that pussy like Hulk Hogan
I know you know my slogan, if it ain't 'bout guap I'm gone
Niggas hatin' cause I'm chosen
from the concrete I had rose
Shawty starin' at my necklace
cause my diamonds really froze
Put that dick up in her pussy bet she feel it in her toes
I'm a real young nigga from the six throwing bows
I'm a real young nigga from the six throwing bows
Real young nigga from the six throwing bows

In the cut I'm rolling up my broccoli
Ya I know your baby mama fond of me

Said that I can hit that shit so greasily

I got companies and Pesos
I got people on my payroll
She don't do it 'less I say so
I don't smoke if it ain't fuego
I should sauce 'em up like Prego
Fettucini with Alfredo
All I wanted was the fame and every game
they made on Sega
I was five or six years old
when I had told myself ok you're special
But I treat you like my equal never lesser
I was twenty-six years old
when we had dropped this one amazing record
Had the world stepping
That's what I call epic
Couple summers later I got paper
I acquired taste for salmon on a bagel
With the capers on a square plate
At the restaurant with the why you got to stare face
To know I either ball or I record over the snare and bass
Rapper face, dread headed
Golden diamond teeth wearing
They just mad cause I got that cheese bitch I keep dairy
Turnt up in the party getting lit to Yachty
With a Spanish Barbie word to my mami

Oh grave, where is thy victory?
Oh life, you are a shining path
And hope springs eternal just over the rise
When I see my Redeemer beckoning me

Oh roll my ship over the waves of Your sea
Let me find a safe port now and then
Don’t let the Dark One in Your sanctuary
Until it’s time to pack it in

Oh roll my ship with the fire of Your breath
And don’t lay a broadside on Your ship as yet
Blow Ye warm winds when it’s chilly and wet
And don’t come too soon for collecting my debt

(Chorus)
Oh death, where is thy sting?
Oh grave, where is thy victory?
Oh life, you are a shining path
And hope springs eternal just over the rise
When I see my Redeemer beckoning me

Oh let me sail on with my ships to the East
And keep my eye on the North Star
When the journey is no good for men or for beast
I’ll be safe wherever You are

Just let me sail into Your harbor of lights
And there and forever to cast out my line
Give me my task and let me do it right
And do it with all of my might

But I’m not gonna stay in this little room
I’m not gonna die in the hospital

[Verse 1]
Those 3 plus years, I was so proud of
Then I threw them all away, for two Styrofoam cups
The irony - everyone will think that ""he lied to me.""
Made my sobriety so public there's no fucking privacy
If I don't talk about it then I carry a date
08/10/08 - now that has been changed
And everyone that put me in some box is ashamed
That I never was - just a false prophet that never came
And will they think that everything 
that I've written has all been fake?
Or will I just take my slip to the grave?
What the fuck are my parents gonna say?
The success story that got his life together and changed
And you know, what pain looks like
When you tell your dad you relapsed 
and look at him directly into his face
The seat on your shoulders, the seemingly heavy weight
Haven't seen tears like this on my girl in a while
The trust that I once built has been betrayed
But I'd rather live tellin' the truth 
and be judged for my mistakes
Than falsely held up, given props, loved and praised
I guess, I gotta get this on the page
Feelin', sick and helpless
Lost the compass where self is
I know what I've gotta do, and I can't help it
One day at a time is what they tell us
Now I've gotta find a way to tell them...
God help him...

[Hook: Ben Bridwell of Band of Horses]
We fell, so hard
Now we gotta get back what we lost
Lost
I thought you'd go
But you were with me all along
Along

[Verse 2]
And every kid that came up to me
And said I was the music they listened to when they first got clean
Now look at me - a couple days sober, I'm fighting demons
Back of that meeting on the East Side, shakin' tweakin'
Hope that they don't see it, hope that no one is lookin'
That no one recognizes that failure under that hoodie
Just posted in the back with my hands crossed, shook-en
If they call on me I'm passin' it, they talk to me I'm bookin'
Out that door, but before, I can make it
Somebody stops me and says ""Are you Macklemore?
""Maybe this isn't the place or time, I just wanted to say that...
If it wasn't for 'Otherside' I wouldn't have made it...""
I just looked down at the ground and say ""Thank you.""
She tells me she has 9 months and that she's so grateful
Tears in her eyes lookin' like she's gonna cry, fuck
I barely got forty-eight hours, treated like I'm some wise monk
I want to tell her I relapsed, but I can't
I just shake her hand and tell her ""Congrats""
Get back to my car, and I think I'm trippin', yeah
Cause God wrote 'Otherside', that pen was in my hand
I'm just a flawed man - Man, I fucked up...
Like so many others, I just never thought I would
I never thought I would, didn't pick up the book
Doin' it by myself didn't turn out that good

Came to london, she's a nothing, a no one, she's undone.
Broken dreams, stolen freedom,
Trapped in the night, trafficked and beaten.
All a part of an evil economy, 
nothing more than someones commodity...

Watching while the world falls apart, 
how do we let this stuff begin?

Put some forgis on my old school and I had to gut it
But should I put a roof in?

Is from nine to nine
Nobody wantsa user
Nobody needs a loser
So kick him out that door

It's a Greenwich Mean Time
Your friends all hate each other you think
You've got another
But who's at the door?
Don't answer it no more

In a bedroom crime
There's a tape recording on a telephone line
An' it's ringin from the floor
So don't answer it no more

It was raining drugs all afternoon.
I hear this car pull up outside
Comes to a stop like, skreeee

Someone's in a hurry
'N someone better worry
'Cos these four guys all had on their feet
A pair of black shoes shining and neat
I thinks

Blackshoes on
No that's bad news
Here they come charging up the stairs alright

April 26th, 1992,
There was a riot on the streets,
Tell me where were you? 
You were sittin home watchin your tv,
While I was paticipatin in some anarchy.

First spot we hit it was my liqour store.
I finally got all that alcohol I cant afford.
With red lights flashin time to retire,
And then we turned that liquor store into a structure
fire.

Next stop we hit it was the music shop,
It only took one brick to make that window drop.
Finally we got our own p.a.
Where do you think I got this guitar that youre
hearing today? 
Hey!

Never doin no time

When we returned to the pad to unload everything,
It dawned on me that I need new home furnishings.
So once again we filled the van until it was full,
Since that day my livin rooms been more comfortable.

Cause everybody in the hood has had it up to here,
Its getting harder and harder and harder each and
every year.

Some kids went in a store with thier mother,
I saw her when she came out she was gettin some
pampers.

They said it was for the black man,
They said it was for the mexican,
And not for the white man.

But if you look at the streets it wasnt about rodney
king,
Its bout this fucked up situation and these fucked up
police.
Its about coming up and staying on top
And screamin 187 on a mother fuckin cop.
Its not written on the paper its on the wall.

And you dance like Zizi Jeanmaire
Your clothes are all made by Balmain
And there's diamonds and pearls in your hair, yes there are

You live in a fancy apartment
Off the Boulevard Saint-Michel
Where you keep your Rolling Stones records
And a friend of Sacha Distel, yes you do

But where do you go to my lovely
When you're alone in your bed
Tell me the thoughts that surround you
I want to look inside your head, yes I do

I've seen all your qualifications
You got from the Sorbonne
And the painting you stole from Picasso
Your loveliness goes on and on, yes it does

When you go on your summer vacation
You go to Juan-les-Pins
With your carefully designed topless swimsuit
You get an even suntan on your back and on your legs

And when the snow falls you're found in Saint Moritz
With the others of the jet-set
And you sip your Napoleon brandy
But you never get your lips wet, no you don't

But where do you go to my lovely
When you're alone in your bed
Won't you tell me the thoughts that surround you
I want to look inside your head, yes I do

Your name, it is heard in high places
You know the Aga Khan
He sent you a racehorse for Christmas
And you keep it just for fun, for a laugh, a-ha-ha-ha

They say that when you get married
It'll be to a millionaire
But they don't realize where you came from
And I wonder if they really care, or give a damn

Where do you go to my lovely
When you're alone in your bed
Tell me the thoughts that surround you
I want to look inside your head, yes I do

I remember the back streets of Naples
Two children begging in rags
Both touched with a burning ambition
To shake off their lowly-born tags, so they try

So look into my face Marie-Claire
And remember just who you are
Then go and forget me forever
But I know you still bear the scar, deep inside, yes you do

I know where you go to my lovely
When you're alone in your bed
I know the thoughts that surround you
'Cause I can look inside your head

So your brother's bound and gagged 
And they've chained him to a chair
Won't you please come to chicago just to sing			
In a land that's known as freedom how can such a thing be fair
won't you please come to chicago for the help that we can bring

We can change the world rearrange the world
It's dying - to get better

Politicians sit yourselves down, there's nothing for you here
won't you please come to chicago for a ride
don't ask jack to help you `cause he'll turn the other ear
won't you please come to chicago or else join the other side

We can change the world rearrange the world
it's dying - if you believe in justice
dying - and if you believe in freedom
dying - let a man live his own life
dying - rules and regulations, who needs them open up the door

Somehow people must be free I hope the day comes soon
won't you please come to chicago show your face
From the bottom of the ocean to the mountains of the moon	
won't you please come to chicago no one else can take your place

We can change the world rearrange the world
It's dying - if you believe in justice
dying - and if you believe in freedom
dying - let a man live his own life
dying - rules and regulations, who needs them open up the door

Are you optimistic 'bout the way things are going?
No, I never ever think of it at all

Don't you ever worry
When you see what's going down?

No, I try to mind my business, that is, no business at all

When it's time to function as a feeling human being
Will your Bachelor of Arts help you get by?

I hope to study further, a few more years or so
I also hope to keep a steady high

Will you try to change things
Use the power that you have, the power of a million new ideas?

What is this power you speak of and this need for things to change?
I always thought that everything was fine

Don't you feel repression just closing in around?
No, the campus here is very, very free

Don't it make you angry the way war is dragging on?
Well, I hope the President knows what he's into, I don't know

Don't you ever see the starvation in the city where you live
All the needless hunger all the needless pain?

I haven't been there lately, the country is so fine
But my neighbors don't seem hungry 'cause they haven't got the time

Thank you for the talk, you know you really eased my mind
I was troubled by the shapes of things to come

Well, if you had my outlook your feelings would be numb
You'd always think that everything was fine

And spend it all until I'm swallowing dirt
Cause I ain't never see a Brinks truck follow a hearse
I ain't never see a dead man taking the stand
I ain't never see a nigga swallow a bullet
And live to talk about it
'Bout that bread, I drop a coffin 'bout it

Even though I'm in love, sometimes I get so afraid

I know the moment is right

Verse one

I seen you from afar
Nice frame and your braids long
Gucci bag matching your frames ma
And like a don I approached you
I'm not the player type
But if you play it right
Ma I'll coach you
I'll put it down how I'm spose to
A popular dude
But I'm tryna to see what's poppin with you
Know a little bout the kid cuz she's been watching my moves
Got my picture on the wall from when I popped in the news
And true
I been runnin' the town
Lot a chicks thought I was nuttin
All of a sudden, wanting me know
Doing research and hunting me down
But never mind the stuntin'
Trying to see what's on your mind and something
Got a place to unwind, it's nothing
Have a wild discussion
Imma roll some of this, ride n then puff it
Yea, we start off slow, then kick it in gear
Off of that smooth shit, I kick in the air
To keep the conversation

Chorus

Ride, I'm in to taking my time, so I

Verse 2

Here I go, putting myself out there
Really trying to see what shorty about here
Nothing to doubt here
See what you get
Get what you see
Me I keep it 100%
Never see myself loving a chick, you might change that
And if not, I'm happy being the same cat you
Think it's a shame that, that's how it has to be
But you with another dude, that'd be sad to see
You still mad at me, some high school tragedy
Seeing how I played your home girl who had it bad for me
I'm like woah, slow down baby, and
Kick it with your man itta go down crazy
I wanna get to know ya
Talk to ya hold ya
And them places you ain't been

And she gone' let the kid handle his biz

Verse 3

I hit your girl with that slick talk, won't see her again
Drop the top, let your hair go, free in the wind
Now we can go and get a room on the other side of town
Or give me head in the whip if you wanna ride around
Roll up the koheeba getting blunted by the pound
I made it to the top, who thought I rubbled from the ground
Bird city, who holdin it down, me and my man whiz
Hit the club, Buy the bar, we let the champ fizz
Knockin couple of brauds you know the plan is
We call the whole crew, and then we ran trillz
I'm so street I feel a part of the canvas
Hard knocks University the heart of the campus
And you know I got my PHD
But that don't stand for player hating
That's a Pimpin Heavy Degree

There's some that say we won't last
Say that we could never beat the the odds
But we just look at them and laugh
As the pressure surges through our heads so strong
The heavy side of life
Keeps us going day by day
Our enemies we won't forgive
Condemn them to a life of pain

[chorus]
Can't you guess what this has done to us?
It gave us power!  It's a way of life!
There's no separation
Total annihilation
Crushing through creation
'Til death do us part!

Gathered crushing force of one
Eluding all the basic obstacles
But we're all in this game for fun
So say fuck off to your politics!
We write the songs we want
And spell it out the way it is
Our music is not a front
It's all about the way we live!

Yeah, you already know what it is (swerve)
It's noisy off the set path
How can I make choices I've yet to discover we have?
Must need rehab
If you think you know me from the facets
They show these folks to get money, I gotta laugh
How funny it is you don't realize the skill lies
In knowing within the truth there's still lies
It's called being civilized
But not to trivialize your belief in the semi-fictionalized
I am who you see
What you hear is part of me
But there's so much more to me
So much more to be than just alive
A son, a brother, a husband, a father
But still can go even farther
Wish and will, can go harder
In that time, I went the hardest
More than this generic term artist
A reality smith, you love my craftsmanship
Because I craft some shit to make my people proud
And so I speak aloud, but not loud enough yet
Or as loud as I can get
They think I ain't a threat
But all preconceived notions, I've arrived
To offset

I missed the first years of your life, I'm sorry
Tell the truth, I ain't really know if I was your father
Tell the truth, I really don't even know your mama
But I had to step up, my daddy had left us
Even though we gotta catch up, pray to God that he bless us
I'ma keep grindin' for my kids, never gon' let up
I'ma put the money up for y'all, I can't be selfish
Had a baby as a kid, mama kicked me out
Had to go and hit a lick, tryna put food in your mouth
Then I got caught for the shit, in the pen when she pushed you out
Your mama tried to push me down, ain't let me stay at the house

Gotta thank your mama, she hold me like holsters
Gotta protect her from the world, I can't even post her

If I don't ball, then everything 'round me fall

No father, no master
A shadow in silence

Put up for adoption
And left with no option
Another kid fostered
To fester forgotten

Take a look into these desperate eyes
As they're cast into the wretched hive

But I ain't going down alone
Is there anybody out there?
Anybody listening to me?
Is anybody else scared?
The paranoia, drops me to my knees
Does anybody feel lonely?
Disconnected from the things I see
Is there anybody out there?
Anybody out there just like me?

Now I stand as a father
To men with no honor
Ashamed of the racists
I used to call brothers

Cause no flag can mean bravery
When bloodied by slavery
The rebel, a devil, disguised as a savior

And the sickening feeling in the air
Is the fear to speak that no one dares

So will I stand here all alone?

Is anybody else scared?

Will I walk what I talk

Will I open my heart
Can you trust when I give him my word
Will I judge him or love him
But nothing above him
Help him to see what he's worth
Can I attend to his needs?
When he's down to his knees?
Can I till the light in his eyes
Can I lend him a hand
And he'll still be a man
Can I run but still be by his side

I am my brother's keeper
Yes I am!
Am I my brother's teacher?
Yes I am!
Am I the one to reach him?
Yes I am!
Am I my brother's keeper?
Yes I am!

Can he push to the edge when he's out on a ledge?
Can I help him to think with his heart
When he's wrong when he's right
I'll be there to remind him
He's made in the image of God
When he's troubled with troubles
He needs to know
That his mistakes don't define his life
I'm a living example that there's a chance for redemption
On the other side

I'm my brother's keep

'Cause no one told me
But you deserve to know
That in this world, you are not beholden
You do not owe them
Your body and your soul

All the youth in the world will not save you from growing older
And all the truth in a girl
is too precious to be stolen from her

It's just the way it is
Maybe it's never gonna change
But I got a mind to show my strength
And I got a right to speak my mind
And I'm gonna pay for this
They're gonna burn me at the stake
But I got a fire in my veins
I wasn't made to fall in line
No, I wasn't made to fall in line, no

Know your own way home

But my tribe don't quest like love
Pain in this bitch, with a mask and a glove
And a team of lawyers to run the train on the judge
It's no risk without gain
It's no trust without shame
It's no us without 'cain
Push, my name is my name
In the kitchen with a cape on, apron
Tre-eight on, coulda been trayvon
But instead i chose avon
Powder face like a geisha
Arm & hammer for the breakup
Turn one into two, watch the brick kiss and makeup
It's a match made in heaven, all that's missing is a reverend
All that's missing is a blessing
I hope god gets the message

I wanna say what's on my motherfuckin' conscious
The whole world right now is fucking bonkers
The internet is the brand new conqueror
So watch out for the motherfuckin' monsters (yikes!)
The trolls are the taunters
Whoever controls the data got the answers
They the ones that got the code to the launcher
And they be having dinner with the Pope and the mobsters
They know the cure for the cancer
Cure for the AIDS and they probably killed the panthers
Put us in a cage got us living like hamsters
Put us in the dark but I got me a lantern
Open up my third eye, then I illuminate
Willy got a bird eye view when I elevate
No Illuminati baby I'm god body

Know thy self and you can do anything
Know thy self and you could shine like bling
Know thy self and you're the king, you're the ring
But they don't teach kids nothing
All they know is I'll pass sugar in they muffins
They don't know division, won't add to nothing
Send them off to prison when you know they did nothing
He in the streets cause they always cuttin'
The teacher ain't teaching him nothin'
All they do was stuffin' him and stuffin' him
Stuffin' him and stuffin' him and stuffin' him
Stuffin' him and stuffin' him and stuffin' him
Stuffin' him with stuff he can't use
So he sell crack, that's what he know to do
His daddy was a hustler, so he hustle too
And that's why you see a lil' killer in the news

Leaders stumbled cross while we leading to our crosses

Folks shrining up the ship for the startup
Money over people while they reaching for that dollar
All I see is slice on the shrimp
Lenin the three but what the fuck is three?
What is the cost to let a nigga breath?
King had a dream but we all still asleep, huh
They ride a blind, but now they just a crime
The shit's designed to keep you on the grind

Look, I feel blessed
Way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed
Straight up

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I live the life I deserve, bless
Fuck a vacay I feel better at work
I mean whatever it's worth
I give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gonna go to Hell and back for me
I'mma give em Heaven on Earth for a hell of a check
Yeah whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life man thats lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like its a reverend
I tell the truth like father forgive me these are all my confessions
Man this wasn't luck it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd, and Eddy
Who flip like confetti and then when you back they back to call you dog
That shit get get petty, bitch don't give no dap to me nigga
Funny thing about talkin' behind my back
Is that it just keep comin' back to me nigga
Was all for a sec now its back to me nigga
You mad at me, this ain't what I want man this what it had to be
This is that late night workin' after three
Man this why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty
Man, the clique is the tightest, the pussy's the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just got it, thank God that we got it, blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your prophet will profit, oh God

[Hook: Drake]
I'm here for a good time not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed
I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, I ain't gonna say that we back or nothin'
Cuz that implies that we're back from somethin'
If we're back from somethin' its some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothin' less or over
I dont need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks bout' where the Grammy's go
I just gave out Grammy's on my Instagram
Them Ovo boys the business man
It is what it is, trust me you get what you give
You gotta come to my side and see how we live
I cannot see Heaven bein' much better than this
Blessings on blessings from me and my niggas from the Six
Look at what we did
Be quiet I'm doin' a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit I swear y'all be doin' the most
Stop worryin' about whoever's next
I am just worried about my mama worryin' less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need anymore press
I am convinced I'm the only one left thats still doin' this shit man

[Hook: Drake]

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
My grandma just died I'm the man of the house
So every mornin' I'm up cause I can't let them down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align you do like the solar system
and plan it out
So I'm goin' overtime on the overtime
Yeah I'm not invested but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, man its to manifest it
The family never goin' anorexic
I pay my mortgage and electric
Never goin' under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checkin' off my check list
Try and blow my cake just know thats a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it? s only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart who put it back together

[Hook: Drake]

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I snapchat that whole shit
Tryin' see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God I hope they post it, I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
C3po's like Star Wars
They want me by the road holdin' up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now callin' you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there gettin' homeschooled
I'm blessed, and I was thinkin' 'bout startin' up my own school
A montessori, and the hallway lookin' like a monastery

Why are you crying?
Inside your restless soul your heart is dying
Little one, little one
Your soul is purging
Of love and razor blades
Your blood is surging

Runaway
From the river to the street
And find yourself with your face in the gutter
Your a stray for the salvation army
There is no place like home
When you got no place to go

Little girl, little girl
Your life is calling
The charlatans and saints of your abandon
Little one little one
The sky is falling
The lifeboat of deception is now sailing
In the wake all the way
No rhyme or reason
Your bloodshot eyes
Will show your heart of treason
Little girl, little girl
You dirty liar
You're just a junkie
Preaching to the choir

Runaway
From the river to the street
And find yourself with your face in the gutter
Your a stray for the salvation army
There is no place like home
When you got no place to go

The traces of blood
Always follow home
Like the mascara tears
From your getaway
Your walking with blisters
And running with shears
So wholy
Sister of grace

Please don't rain on my parade
The falling from the sky just remind of the days
When you was crying for attention
I ignored it as a phase
Until you couldn't take the tension
Now I wish you would have stayed
Walking through the smoke and mirrors, I'm burdened, you burning bridges
Memories fading faded it help you not to remember
The trials and tribulations, eyes red from crying
The perfect way to disguise it you was blinded by our fate
Please don't rain on my parade because this float was built for you
Kinda hard to chase you down when you floating through the room
All you wanted was the truth and all I wanted was my way
Regardless how I word the phrase all you hear me say is

I come into this life
The song of a woman
And a man who lived in strife
He was tired of being poor
And he wasn't into selling door to door
And he worked like the devil to be more

A different kind of poverty now upsets my soul
Night after sleepless night
I walk the floor and I want to know
Why am I so alone?
Where is my woman can I bring her home?
Have I driven her away?
Is she gone?

Morning comes to sunrise
And I'm driven to my bed
I see that it is empty
And there's devils in my head
I embrace the many colored beast
I grow weary of the torment
Can there be no peace?
And I find myself just wishing that my life would simply cease.",aprox,200,4+20

Friday, payday, Lordy got to get away
Had it with the wife thing, living on a shoe string
What’s a poor girl got to do just to have some fun?
All these years without any help
Guess what, honey, clothes just don’t wash themselves!
Neither do dishes, neither does the bathroom floor

So, now if anyone asks, not that they would
I’ll be down in Mississippi and up to no good

No more, what a bore, had enough, I’m out the door
Headed for a breakdown, had it with the small town
Gonna call Lisa, gonna call Carla Sue
Now we’re gonna let it roll, gonna let it rip
Gonna get us a nice room down on the strip
Not that we’ll need it, there won’t be any sleepin’ tonight

So, now if anyone asks, not that they would
We’ll be down in Mississippi and up to no good

Hammer down, here we go
Runnin’ for the riverboat
All you’re gonna see is asses and elbows
Luck’s about to change for these three queens
Tired of getting’ jokers, deal us up kings

Snake eyes, roll the dice, double down and hit me twice
Cashin’ in the big chips, gonna leave a big tip
Hotter than a two dollar pistol, baby, I’m on fire

So, now if anyone asks, not that they would

Picture this, in bed, get a phone call
Girl that you fucked with killed herself
That was this summer and nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic

All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave
I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions:
Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months
they had a nigga locked up

I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain

And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb

we could ride out in the darkness
chasing the rising sun
we gotta pack our bags this instant
we're riding southbound til the next town
and if we arrive there s-safely
baby you could lay me down
lay me down
lay me down hahownn
lay me down

[Duddy B]

well it's the story of the two, always on the move
they got nothing left to lose
'cept their guns and their wounds
now they're crossing borders 
sheriff's posse on their tail
they'd rather die together than be stuck up in a cell
they drank up all the whiskey 
and they partied every night
like it could be the last, 
the bounty said to 'shoot on sight'
they're chasing in the summer, 
knew it came with a price 
they wouldn't stop running 
til they found the paradise
but the sheriff finally found them 
with his eyes seeing red
so the lovers had to shoot him down 
and fill him full of lead
they were finally free 
to find a place to lay their head
and when he finally did he looked at her and he said

[Rome]

I said I think that we can stay here
cuz I fell our time has come
and we can walk down to the ocean
and sit with the rising sun
so unpack your bags this instant
no more running from town to town
and now that we've arrived so safely
baby you can lay me down

lay me downnn
lay me downhahownn
lay me downnnnnnnnnn

[Duddy B]

well you're my green eyed girl and I been running around with you
it's the afternoon and we got nothing left to do
so wipe the dirt off, take your shirt off
and we should go hit the cantina; we got work off

I said it's hot outside let me go swimming in your eyes
we been running for awhile why don't you lay down I'll make you smile
I could never ask for nothing better than this
it's just tequila and the beach, it's quite salty when we kiss

High above the clouds....
Swear I won't look back, if I get the chance
I won't come back around

Yo, have you ever laid in bed and it's late in the night,
Starin' at the ceiling talkin' to God about life?
Askin' when it's gon' happen, just maybe it might
Made a lot of life turns, some wrong and some right
Wanna know when it's your second, your minute, your time
Sick of dreamin', wanna lay the pictures in your mind
Never been like all the others, you're one of a kind
I know you're feelin' like you wanna break free, it's a sign
Just wanna fly above it all, see where you can land
Know that you can do it on your own 'cause you can
Know that you can conquer all with a plan
Forget about the negatives buried in the sand
Yeah, never forget this is your life
Your path, your dream, this is your fight
Victory, you'll see, you'll be alright
Get through the darkness, on the other end is pure light

When I close my eyes I can see me flying home
High above the clouds
Swear I won't look back if I get the chance
Oh? I won't come back around
If I make it out this town, yeah?
Gotta make it out this town, yeah?
I'm gonna make it out this town, yeah?
I'm gonna roll the dice, and take a risk tonight
Gotta make it out this town

Have you ever felt alone like the whole world was missin'?
And when you prayed it seemed like no one was listenin'
You try to keep the faith and keep on livin'
But when you strugglin', the future looks distant
All your hopes seem to be just pipe dreams
And you really gotta wonder what your life means
That's when you gotta pick yourself up out the dust
Make a change and find a place in your heart to trust
You ain't always gotta take the first call to dough
In this life, only you can represent yourself
Never let your circumstances hold you back
You were born free, never gotta feel trapped
In the pursuit of happiness, you're gonna feel pain
But the only way to win is to stay in the game
The naysayers, they goon' try and embarrass ya
But I've learned that the struggle builds character

When I close my eyes I can see me flying home
High above the clouds
Swear I won't look back if I get the chance
Oh? I won't come back around
If I make it out this town, yeah?
Gotta make it out this town, yeah?
I'm gonna make it out this town, yeah
I'm gonna roll the dice, and take a risk tonight
Gotta make it out this town

Put your hands in the air now
If you feel it let me hear you loud
Put your hands in the air now!
Yeah, if ain't nobody gonna hold you down
Yeah, come on, come on...

When I close my eyes I can see me flying home
High above the clouds
Swear I won't look back if I get the chance

Where sin and sorrow are all done away?
Peace abounds like a river, they say

There's some whose hearts
were burdened with care
They paid for their moment with fighting and tears
But they clung to the cross trembling in fear
But what are they doing there now?

Where sin and sorrow are all done away?

Physicians and doctors couldn't give them much ease
But they suffered 'til death brought a final release

Who's putting sponge in the bells I once rung
And taking my gypsy before she's begun
To singing in the meaning of what's in my mind
Before I can take home what's rightfully mine
Joinin' and listenin' and talkin' in rhymes
Stoppin' the feeling to wait for the times

'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing

And who's all hung-up on that happiness thing
Who's trying to tune all the bells that he rings
And who's in the corner and down on the floor
With pencil and paper just counting the score
Who's trying to act like he's just in between
The line isn't black, if you know that it's green
Don't bother looking, you're too blind to see
Who's coming on like he wanted to be

And who's coming home on the old nine-to-five
Who's got the feeling that he came alive
Though havin' it, sharin' it ain't quite the same
It ain't no gold nugget, you can't lay a claim

You'll forever live on, forever live on
You'll forever live on, forever live on 
You'll forever live on, you'll forever live on 
You'll forever live on, you'll forever live on

Verse 1:
I never thought that wearing no hoodie, could cause 
Your life.
And I never thought you could just kill somebody and go 
Out the 
Same night.
Every dog that you see that bark, don't mean that he 
Bite.
And everything thats black ain't evil, everything 
That's pure ain't 
White
Cause you think that im doin wrong don't mean that you 
Right.
Cause the ones that you think that won't, them the ones 
That might.
Certain people in this world the system don't like.
When you living what you worth is how they value your 
Life.
I can do all things through christ, who strengthen me.
And even when I pray I pray for my enemies.
And pac said it best ""only god can judge me.""
Trayvon lil homie, I want you to know you really 
Touched me.

Sometimes trying to live right, sometimes it seems so 
Wrong, 
Sometimes you tryin to get justice, sometimes it take 
So long.
But the ones they supposed to keep in, be the ones they 
Let go home.
But the ones that hustle and survive, be the ones they 
Hold  with no 
Bond.
My son supposed to burry me, but I ain posed to burry 
My son.
You can call me nigga all you want, but you ain't pose

Like one,
Pose to be able to express my self, and be able to 
Dress how I 
Want.
Pose to be able to go where I please, and be able to 
Leave when I'm 
Done.
Should I think that you sell dope, just cause you drive 
A benz.
Should I think that zack in a gang, just cause he sag

Look in the mirror and think she was dead

Walk slowly to the door
Go into town hoping to score
Did she find her a man who said he'd give her all he can
And when that's not enough then life starts to get tough

Did she die in the cold
Was she scared to be old

I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
You're the one that was trying to keep me way down
But like the sun know you know I found my way back round

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Look
They tell me I should fix my grill cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing but it's funny how
My shit is crooked look at how far I done got without it
I keep my twisted grill, just to show them kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich, and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Oh, you a woman? I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you
Killing yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror but its clear that you can't face
what's wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paint brush on
Your roommate yelling, ""Why you gotta take so long? ""
What it's like to have a crooked smile
This crooked smile

I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
You're the one that was trying to keep me way down
But like the sun know you know I found my way back round

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
Cause he don't seem to want you back and it got you asking
So all you see is what you lacking, not what you packing
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl you're a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? if it's not, girl you don't care
Cause what's real is something that the eyes can't see
That the hands can't touch
that them broads can't be, and that's you
Never let 'em see you frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I'll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain't laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile

[Hook]
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
You're the one that was trying to keep me way down

Crooked smile, we could style on 'em (back 'round)
Crooked smile, we could style on 'em (back 'round)

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
We don't look nothing like the people on the screen
You know them movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase' em
Look at the nation, that's a crooked smile braces [
couldn't even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation, or in jail
Wonder why we inhale, cause we in hell already
I asked if my skin pale
would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
Yo one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga let's make a mil
Hey officer man, we don't want nobody getting killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother out of jail
I got money for the bail now, well now
If you asking will I tell now? Hell naw
I ain't snitching cause
Man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around, then you wouldn't need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?

Things like that just never mattered much to her
Plus she don't watch too much T.V.

She don't care that I can fly her, to places she ain't never been

That, all she has to say is when

I sit alone in my four-cornered room staring at candles
Oh that shit is on? Heh
Let me drop some shit like this here Real smooth

Verse One: Scarface

At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Candle sticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Four walls just staring at a nigga
I'm paranoid, sleeping with my finger on the trigga
My momma's always stressing I ain't living right
But I ain't going out without a fight
See, everytime my eyes close
I start sweatin, and blood starts comin out my nose
It's somebody watchin' the Ak' 
But I don't know who it is, so I'm watchin my back
I can see him when I'm deep in the covers
When I awake I don't see the motherfucker
He owns a black hat like I own
A black suit and a cane like my own
Some might say ""take a chill, G""
But fuck that shit, there's a nigga trying to kill me
I'm poppin' in a clip when the wind blows
Every twenty seconds got me peeping out my window
Investigating the joint for traps
Checking my telephone for taps
I'm staring at the woman on the corner
It's fucked up when your mind is playing tricks on you

Verse Two: Willie D

I make big money, I drive big cars
Everybody know me, it's like I'm a movie star
But late at night, somethin ain't right
I feel I'm being tailed by the same sucker's head lights
Is it that fool that I ran off the block
Or is it that nigga last week that I shot
Or is it the one I beat for five thousand dollars
Thought he had 'caine but it was Gold Medal Flour
Reach under my seat, grabbed my popper for the suckers
Ain't no use to be lying, I was scareder than a motherfucker
Hooked a left into Popeyeâ€™s and beared down quick
If it's going down let's get this shit over with
Here they come, just like I figured
I got my hand on the motherfucking trigger
What I saw'll make your ass start giggling
Three blind, crippled and crazy senior citizens
I live by the sword
I take my boys everywhere I go
Because I'm paranoid
I keep looking over my shoulder and peeping around corners 
My mind is playing tricks on me

Verse Three: Scarface

Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doing dope
Can't keep a steady hand because I'm nervous
Every Sunday morning I'm in service
Praying for forgiveness
And trying to find an exit out of the business
I know the Lord is looking at me
But yet and still it's hard for me to feel happy
I often drift when I drive
Havin fatal thoughts of suicide
BANG and get it over with
And then I'm worry-free, but that's bullshit
I got a little boy to look after
And if I died then my child would be a bastard
I had a woman down with me
But to me it seemed like she was down to get me
She helped me out in this shit
But to me she was just another bitch
Now she's back with her mother
Now I'm realizing that I love her
Now I'm feeling lonely
My mind is playing tricks on me

Verse Four: Bushwick Bill

This year Halloween fell on a weekend
Me and Geto Boyz are trick-or-treating
Robbing little kids for bags
Till a law man got behind our ass
So we speeded up the pace
Took a look back and he was right before our face
He'd be in for a squable no doubt
So I swung and hit the nigga in his mouth
He was going down, we figga'd
But this wasnâ€™t no ordinary nigga
He stood about six or seven feet
Now, that's the nigga I'd been seeing in my sleep
So we triple-teamed on him
Dropping them motherfuckin beads on him
The more I swung the more blood flew
Then he disappeared and my boys disappeared, too
Then I felt just like a fiend
It wasn't even close to Halloween
It was dark as fuck on the streets
My hands were all bloody from punching on the concrete

We made love like the world would have ended?
If either of us had admitted
We were in love?
So I was the only one?

And I should've never fucked you on a boat on your birthday
And I never would've came into your house in the first place

Every weekend turned to every evening
You took me out and left me in the deep end then

I would cry and watch you stare

not felt
not heard

fists are for beating
scabs are for healing
and blood is for bleeding

at the TV set wasting power

But the stars have all gone out tonight.
I feel like the love of my life is dying.

Headin' down to Austin.
I wonder if she misses me tonight.

How much I love her.

Super high, can't touch the ground

From the jailhouse junk to the Testarossa

Fuck up, I'm grown, I got to blame myself
Streets taught me everything, I trained myself
Dead wrong so long, didn't know nothin' else
They wanna lock my crew up like?
Think every man? and amuse himself
Glad as well, but I'm mad as hell
Because my best friend probably gon' die in jail
Ain't no lie to tell, probably cry like hell
If I dwell on it, cause he got 80 years
I'm going hard, you see I might as well
Cause I got a hard head like my daddy had
And my daddy's dead
I bet my great great great great grandpa had a real crazy swag
So I stand today, then get down to pray
? and my mind is made
I got a point to prove, and a son to raise
Can't let him make mistakes that his daddy made

I done rob stealed killed, ain't proud of that
Smoke weed, took pills
I'm a soldier? where the cowards at?
Man your homeboy gone where the flowers at
All the money in the world can't bring that back
If I had one wish, wish mom and dad could
Come down now and see me rap
But she see me now, and I believe in that
On the strength of that I ain't goin' back
So I put my whole family on my back
Lost so much time, can't pay that back

Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle cruising blue behind my waters
No welfare supporters more conscious
Of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot my son got knocked evidentaly
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping out of state for a plate knowledge
Of coke was cooked without the garbage
We'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashing, fashion
Designer clothes, lacing your click up with diamond vogues
Your people holding dough, no parole
No rubbers, go in raw imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
watch the blimp read ""The World Is Mine""

Be mine, we'd both shine

In these last days and times

The way to be, paradise like relaxing black
Latino and anglo-saxon
Armani exchange the reins
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash then we laugh in the iller path
The Villa house is for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better living, type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controlling, click rolling
Tricking six digits on kicks and still holding
Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage
Gimme one shot I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoner set free, stress free
No work release purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities
And reverse themes to Willies

No father, no master
A shadow in silence
Left searching for answers

Put up for adoption
And left with no option
Another kid fostered
To fester forgotten

Take a look into these desperate eyes
As they're cast into the wretched hive

But I ain't going down alone
Is there anybody out there?
Anybody listening to me?
Is anybody else scared?
The paranoia, drops me to my knees
Does anybody feel lonely?
Disconnected from the things I see
Is there anybody out there?
Anybody out there just like me?
I'm choking on these words and I can't breathe

Now I stand as a father
To men with no honor
Ashamed of the racists
I used to call brothers

Cause no flag can mean bravery
When bloodied by slavery
The rebel, a devil, disguised as a savior

And the sickening feeling in the air
Is the fear to speak that no one dares

So will I stand here all alone?
Is there anybody out there?
Anybody listening to me?
Is anybody else scared?
The paranoia, drops me to my knees
Does anybody feel lonely?
Disconnected from the things I see
Is there anybody out there?
Anybody out there just like me?
I'm choking on these words and I can't breathe

Live my life like I'll die tonight
Dream like I'll live forever

I have roared at the world for years
Doesn't anybody hear me?
This burden suffered, I've paid the cost
Not all who wander are lost

Is there anybody out there?
Anybody listening to me?
Is anybody else scared?
The paranoia, drops me to my knees
Does anybody feel lonely?
Disconnected from the things I see
Is there anybody out there?

I got up and dialed your number 
Your voice came on the line 
That old familiar message 
I have heard a thousand times 
It just said, sorry that I missed you 
Leave a message and god bless 
I know that you think I am crazy 
But I just had to hear your voice I guess

All alone in my room in the middle of the night

I don't wanna be a Christian, Muslim, gay, straight, or bi, see you later, bye
Not perceived by the things I believe or the color of my skin
Or the fact I'm attracted to her, maybe him
Or the fact I'm a single mother living all alone
Looking for a man and a home to call my own
But I already have one
The only man I'ma ever need is my son, my son, my son, my son

Fuck everybody hatin' on me right now, I'm black and proud

24690,24690,Songs with political statements,A Few Words in Defense of Our Country,Randy Newman,"I’d like to say a few words
In defense of our country
Whose people aren’t bad nor are they mean
Now the leaders we have
While they’re the worst that we’ve had
Are hardly the worst this poor world has seen

Let’s turn history’s pages, shall we?

Take the Caesars for example
Why within the first few of them
They were sleeping with their sister
Stashing little boys in swimming pools
And burning down the City
And one of ‘em, one of 'em
Appointed his own horse Consul of the Empire
That’s like vice president or something

That’s not a very good example, is it?

But wait, here’s one, the Spanish Inquisition
They put people in a terrible position
I don’t even like to think about it

Well, sometimes I like to think about it

Just a few words in defense of our country
Whose time at the top
Could be coming to an end
Now we don’t want their love
And respect at this point is pretty much out of the question
But in times like these
We sure could use a friend

Hitler. Stalin.
Men who need no introduction

King Leopold of Belgium. That’s right.
Everyone thinks he’s so great
Well he owned The Congo
He tore it up too
He took the diamonds, he took the gold
He took the silver
Know what he left them with?

Malaria

A President once said,
""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself""
Now it seems like we’re supposed to be afraid
It’s patriotic in fact and color coded
And what are we supposed to be afraid of?
Why, of being afraid
That’s what terror means, doesn’t it?
That’s what it used to mean

[To the first eight bars of  ""Columbia The Gem Of The Ocean""]

You know it pisses me off a little
That this Supreme Court is gonna outlive me
A couple of young Italian fellas and a brother on the Court now too
But I defy you, anywhere in the world
To find me two Italians as tightass as the two Italians we got

And as for the brother
Well, Pluto’s not a planet anymore either

The end of an empire is messy at best
And this empire is ending
Like all the rest
Like the Spanish Armada adrift on the sea
We’re adrift in the land of the brave
And the home of the free

Maybe just a good night's sleep
Would have changed your troubled mind
From that rather permanent decision
So tragic, so unkind
Now, pain is what you've given
And sleep is what you'll get
So far away from that sweet baby child
Who hardly knew you yet

Now he'll grow up to be a fighter
Full of anger, full of shame
Like all the other haunted children
Who wonder why they came
And he'll be in and out of trouble
Until he stands up or he falls
But there will always be a shadow there
No matter how it goes
Damn it, Rose

Is this another cryptic message
Or some kind of cosmic quiz
If there's a lesson to be learned from this
Well, I don't know what it is

You could have given us the finger
Much more constructively than that
Now I sit here with the MTV
And your bloated, Burmese cat
We're being treated to the wisdom
Of some puffed up little fart
Doing exactly what I used to doâ€”
Pretentions to anarchy and art
He speaks the language of a warrior
He mounts his misinformed attack
He wears the clothes of a dissenter
But there's a logo on his back
And it's a hollow rebellion
As rebellions mostly are
It's just another raging tempest in a jar

And the seasons keep on changing
And the wind blows hot and cold
Wish that you were here with us to watch this tide
As it ebbs and flows

We climb but we can't reach the top

She just smiles when I want to stop
Lips, that are weary but tender
With love, that strengthens my life

Two little babies were born in the spring
But died when the winter was new
I lost control of my mind, and my soul
But my woman's faith carried us through

Give her that mansion up yonder
Cause she's been thru hell here on earth

There's no sound from the empty street 
But sleep won't seem to come to me 
All your words in my head 
Linger on and on 
They've come to steal my time away 
Till the night is gone

In a cellar cool and damp 
Dull beneath a yellow lamp 
No one turning the key 
To come and get me today 
The more I think about you now 
The more I'm feeling that way 
I see you there, everywhere 
Optical illusions 
Telephone, let it ring 
I don't want intrusions in my life 
I know tomorrow I'll find 
There's nothing here at all 
Just some trick your mind will play 
With shadows on the wall 
I see you here, feel you near

Nothing real that I feel 
Just some confusion of my time 
In my darkest hour, when all the blinds were drawn 
You're just some mirage I saw

Lady from the mountains
And others say she's not really real
Like a candle burns bright
Wants to burn faster
But maybe then at least
She really feels
Burning like the candle in the middle

She's lonely, lost
She's disconnected
She finds no comfort
In her surroundings
Beautiful, insecure
She has nothing
She moves from situation to situation
Like a ghost
Then she sees him
A candle burning

Strange
She runs with the one she can't keep up with
Ooh it's so strange
He slows down
He's so desperate to stop her
Meet her in the middle
They both run from the one who hunts them
And they drop to the forest floor frozen
They drop to the forest floor frozen

He loves her
But he needs his life alone as well
But does he know
The road or the reasons why
If he leaves her
He'll be losing the chance
To stay alive
But the candle burns bright
Then the candle dies
Burning from the middle
Just like a candle

See that time is of the essence
And this clock doesn't own a home
Rain falls from the heavens to my palace rooftop

By myself On it, my mind is my weakness
Wear your strength, you might surprise yourself
Never deny yourself
I live in the space is my thesis
I know you need this, I know you need this
I'm prone to run out of pieces
That might connect to something bigger
All in your mind, could follow me
You should consider
Look at the time, I'm probably later than ever
What did you find?
Well come in here, and lit them with pressure
I look to the heavens and I saw open gates
I walked up and then I pause
What the fuck did you do this for?
Wish me luck when that midnight falls
Memories of a past life
Can this be this is our time?
Can this be this is our time?
Come on

In stillness
Known to the world, do you feel this?
Trapped in my mind
I'm 'bout to find solitude
I'm connecting all of these pieces
I know you need this, I know you need this
I'm folding, unleash the beast
Unknown is what I would be
If my whole purpose wasn't to speak
Now look at the time
I know that I'm early today
What did you find?
You giving up or running away?
I gazed to the stars
And this view can't be shared
There are no other eyes in this room
Mean the words when you sing your tune
Free as a bird when I intake fumes

I'm tryin to see how deep you are
And believe me shorty

I wanna see if I can make you reach things unobtainable
When I peek into your nature
And I promise you my goals 
well exceed any physical pleasure
I wanna, give you whats better than better
The better my effort, the wetter her treasure
The more these mere moments 
seem like heavens or temporary forevers

May your love come down so my mind might have you
You designed my imagination
Let me redefine foreplay so you need five and

no more talking baby

I'd never been to before
Workin' my way through a middle of June
Midnight thunderstorm
There was somethin' in the headlights
That stopped me on a dime
Well, she was scared to death
So I said, ""Climb in, "" and in she climbed
Oh, yeah

Well, she was bruised and broke from head to toe
With a tear in her blood-stained shirt
She didn't tell the whole truth, but she didn't have to
I knew what had happenеd to her
I didn't load her down with questions
That girl had been through еnough
I just threw it in drive, looked in those eyes
And asked her where he was

I don't know if he's an angel
'Cause angels don't do what he did
He was hellbent to find the man behind
All the whiskey scars I hid
I never thought my day of justice
Would come from a judge under his seat
But I knew right then I'd never get hit again
when he said to me
""Wait in the truck
Just wait in the truck""

Well, I knocked and knocked and no one came
So I kicked in his double-wide door
I let the hammer drop before he got
To that 12 he was reachin' for
I didn't try to hide my pistol
I didn't even try to run
I just sat on the porch, smokin' one of his cigarettes
And waited for the cops to come

I don't know if he's an angel
'Cause angels don't do what he did
He was hellbent to find the man behind
All the whiskey scars I hid
I never thought my day of justice
Would come from a judge under his seat
But I knew right then I'd never get hit again

""Wait in the truck
Just wait in the truck""

Whoa (Oh)
Have mercy on me, Lord
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on me, Lord (Oh)

It's been sixty months and she still comes
To see me from time to time
It was worth the price to see a brighter side
Of the girl I picked up that night
And I might be here forever
It ain't paradise, that's true
But it's a whole hell of a lot better
Than the place I sent him to

Felt abandoned at times
Given into the fall
I can't forget what its like

When I felt numb
And so hollow inside
You carried me through it all
Across the divide

And when I went through it all
You gave me your heart
I learned to forgive
And when I come through it all
I know you're the one
I'll never forget

I pray I'm the one
You'll never forget
I've been lost

Watched it all crumble

Found what I was searching for

For the fans and the cameras
Different places, adventures
And the stress that it brings
Start to wonder if it's worth it
I live life like it's perfect
My children are smiling and that makes me happy
Cause how I was living, I swear it had me
Bouncing my head off the wall
I am too far up, I cannot fall
Having fun, I don't know about y'all
It's ZooVier from ZooGang, I'm the boss
For my kids, give my life with no thought

Bang my head against the wall

But you won't crawl, no, you won't fall

And you might feel light headed

And it's so scary how you trust me.

And I come pouring out like wine.
Dancin'  boy, I'm sure by now that you must see,
You're dancin'  means much more to me,
Than any dream of mine.

Yes, I'm so proud when you are with me,
That my heart digs in my throat.
And when you stop to strut your stuff,
My eyes go all afloat.
And when I have to leave you home
As sometimes it must be.
I feel that with my leaving
I leave far too much of me.

And it's scary how you trust me.

You're dancin'  means much more to me,

When you're dancin'  days are done,
And when daddy and his dancin'  boy
Will have dwindled down to one.

You know the world will've taught you other steps
To match the march of time,
So you'll have to keep our dancin'  days
Dancin'  in your mind.

And a short few words later it all just comes untied?
You can't believe you're looking at what was always someone else
Now it's staring right back at you, yesterday you couldn't tell
So shock and dissolution, helpless and confused
Not knowing how and what to say, not accepting that it's true.
You can't help but see the worst to come a thousand different ways
The same time trying to hold on strong in optimistic games.

When I saw you leaving, when I saw you leaving
When I saw you leaving in my mind.

And the angry starts to surface, looking up, asking why
And you realize he probably wants the best, as same as I
Days just go by quickly, nights just never end
As time gets so more precious, every sunrise and old friend
Trying to be opposed, to lean on, a part you learn is hard to play
Asking God to let you take her place or just take it all away.
Hope you'll wake up in the morning, was all just been a dream
You never take for granted every second that you breathe.

When I saw you leaving, when I saw you leaving
When I saw you leaving in my mind.

And the seconds turn to minutes
And minutes wouldn't last
And the hours, days and weeks and months
Seem endless and too fast
And the lessons just pour from Heaven
Like the rain on that first spring
Since that moment I first saw you
You might not always be with me.

When I saw you leaving, when I saw you leaving
When I saw you leaving in my mind.

I'm lookin' for that big old smile, full of diamonds
Instead, I found this letter you ain't finished writin'
It read, ""I'm sorry for even apologizing""
I tried, comprising and went kamikaze
I found my momma's pistol where she always hide it
I cry, put it to my head and thought about it
Nobody was home to stop me, so I called my auntie
Hung up, then put the gun up to my heart and pondered
Too much was on my conscience to be smart about it
Too torn apart about it, I aim where my heart was pounding
I shot it, and I woke up with blood all around me
It's mine, I didn't die, but as I was dying
God came to my side and we talked about it
He sold me another life and he made a prophet

Are the clanging chimes of doom

Pero si volviera a pasar
Sé que sería tu debilidad

Porque la noche de anoche fue
Algo que yo no puedo explicar
Eso era dando y dándole sin parar
Tú me decías que morías por mí

Porque la noche de anoche fue
Algo que yo no puedo explicar
Eso era dando y dándole sin parar
Tú encima de mí, yo encima de ti

Eh, eh

Tú me dejaste el cuerpo caliente, infierno
Pero me dejaste el corazón frío, invierno
Soñando que contigo es que duermo
(Dime, papi)
Dime, mami

¿Esa noche, quién la borra?
Tú me besaste y se me cayó la gorra
Sin mucha labia, sin mucha cotorra
Cuando estoy contigo, dejo que la vibra corra

Y que la Luna nos supervise
Con esa boquita, suena rico todo lo que tú me dice'
Hicimos poses que yo jamás nunca hice
Tú te mojaste pa' que yo me bautice

Y me ponga serio, serio
Tú y yo juntos creando un imperio
Esos ojitos tienen un misterio
Pero al final na' de lo nuestro fue en serio

Y ya me ha pasa'o que me han ilusiona'o
Y ya me ha pasa'o que me han abandona'o
Y ya me ha pasa'o que no estás a mi la'o
Y ya me ha pasa'o

Tú encima de mí, yo encima de ti

Porque la noche de anoche fue
Algo que yo no puedo explicar

Que yo me iría otra vez pa' Japón (hey)
Papi, qué penita tú, qué maldición (hmm)
La paleta es dulce, azúcar de algodón (yeh)
Y es la única que me llega hasta al corazón

Yo no me olvido, la suerte está echada
Se me enredaba el pelo en la pantalla

25128,25128,Songs with political statements,Darkness (Of Greed),Rage Against the Machine,"Greed
Causing innocent blood to flow
Entire culture lost in the overthrow
They came to see, take whatever they please
Then all they gave back was death and disease

People were left with no choice but to decide
To conform to a system responsible for genocide
Responsible for genocide, Responsible for genocide

AIDS is killing the entire African nation
And a vaccine is still supposedly under preparation
But these governments, they don't mind the procrastination.
They say we'll kill them off, take their land and go there for vacation

My peoples' culture was strong and was pure
And if not for that white greed, it would have endured
My people were left with no choice but to decide
To conform to a system

Their minds did slay
Their souls they cage
You feel the rage
This brutality can never be undone
But the sun has not yet set
The bass and drums and microphone a threat
That's when you've got to get the cry from the inside
And see that they're responsible for genocide
Responsible for genocide, Responsible for genocide

You jam your culture down my throat
Say I'm inferior when apon it I choke
You fill my mind with a false sense of history
And then you wonder why I have no identity

We'll strike a match and it'll catch
And spread the insight we need
A tiny fire burning bright
Shedding light on the darkness of greed

A yes yes yall and you don't stop
Shedding light on the darkness of greed
A yes yes yall and you don't stop
Shedding light on the darkness of greed

Yeah, you already know what it is (swerve)
It's noisy off the set path
How can I make choices I've yet to discover we have?
Must need rehab
If you think you know me from the facets
They show these folks to get money, I gotta laugh
How funny it is you don't realize the skill lies
In knowing within the truth there's still lies
It's called being civilized
But not to trivialize your belief in the semi-fictionalized
I am who you see
What you hear is part of me
But there's so much more to me
So much more to be than just alive
A son, a brother, a husband, a father
But still can go even farther
Wish and will, can go harder
In that time, I went the hardest
More than this generic term artist
A reality smith, you love my craftsmanship
Because I craft some shit to make my people proud
And so I speak aloud, but not loud enough yet
Or as loud as I can get
They think I ain't a threat
But all preconceived notions, I've arrived
To offset

Tryna find my soul when I had you (when I had you)
I was oh so broke when I had you (when I had you)
Locked up down the road when I had you (when I had you)
Jordan, sorry I wasn't there for all your birthdays

Ridin' in the car, you don't play me, then he gon' scream

Kalea, you my first, first daughter
I missed the first years of your life, I'm sorry
Tell the truth, I ain't really know if I was your father
Tell the truth, I really don't even know your mama
But I had to step up, my daddy had left us
Even though we gotta catch up, pray to God that he bless us
I'ma keep grindin' for my kids, never gon' let up
I'ma put the money up for y'all, I can't be selfish
Had a baby as a kid, mama kicked me out
Had to go and hit a lick, tryna put food in your mouth
Then I got caught for the shit, in the pen when she pushed you out
Your mama tried to push me down, ain't let me stay at the house

Keep my past closed, 'member I ain't had no dough
Spend a big bag on clothes, Gucci from the head to toes

Kulture, remind me of my grandma, feel like she is closer
Gotta thank your mama, she hold me like holsters
Gotta protect her from the world, I can't even post her
Ups and downs in this fame, roller coaster
If I don't ball, then everything 'round me fall

Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only get hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preach it to the choir
Any rumor you heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowing the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em really

no matter what happens she ain't going back to Philly

need to put up some god damn barricades

First song they played for me
was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405

But Saint is baby Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him

who had selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance

Pink fur, got Nori dressing like Cam, thank God for me
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!

good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep

And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker

Not out there getting high underneath some neon lights
Ain't no whiskey strong enough to make things right
I'm just getting over another sober Saturday night

Besides the pain. I don't feel a thing
When my buddies call me up I just let it ring

Jerusalem, if I forget you,
fire not gonna come from me tongue.
Jerusalem, if I forget you,
let my right hand forget what it’s supposed to do.

In the ancient days, we will return with no delay
Picking up the bounty and the spoils on our way
We’ve been traveling from state to state
And them don’t understand what they say
3,000 years with no place to be
And they want me to give up my milk and honey
Don’t you see, it’s not about the land or the sea
Not the country but the dwelling of his majesty

[chorus]

Rebuild the temple and the crown of glory
Years gone by, about sixty
Burn in the oven in this century
And the gas tried to choke, but it couldn’t choke me
I will not lie down, I will not fall asleep
They come overseas, yes they’re trying to be free
Erase the demons out of our memory
Change your name and your identity
Afraid of the truth and our dark history
Why is everybody always chasing we
Cut off the roots of your family tree
Don't you know that's not the way to be

[chorus]

Caught up in these ways, and the worlds gone craze
Don’t you know it’s just a phase
Case of the Simon says
If I forget the truth then my words won’t penetrate
Babylon burning in the place, can’t see through the haze
Chop down all of them dirty ways,
That’s the price that you pay for selling lies to the youth
No way, not ok, oh no way, not ok, hey
Aint no one gonna break my stride
Aint no one gonna pull me down
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
Stay alive

Where do we take it from here
Rhinestone suits and new shiny cars
We've been the same way for years
We need to change

Somebody told me when I got to Nashville
Son you finally got it made
Old Hank made it here, weâ€™re all sure that you will
But I don't think Hank done it this way
I don't think Hank done it this way

Ten years down the road, making one night stands
Speeding my young life away
Tell me one more time just so I understand
Are you sure Hank done it this way
Did Ol' Hank really do it this way?

I've seen the world with a five piece band
Looking at the back side of me 
Singing my songs and one of his now and then
But I don't think Hank done 'em this a'way
No I don't think Hank done 'em this a'way

[Verse 1: A$Ap Rocky]
Buccaneers of rugged gear, nigga fuck a fair
One, since year one, I've been thuggin' here, yeah
Whole shit is ours, you in awe, please don't get involved
This is war, walk around a frame with blaze up in this jawn
Behind prison walls, niggas lickin' balls, pause
Different cause, stricted laws
Damn if I don't break up in the mall, prison yard, prison guard
No principal, detention on your friends and all
Commissary missing like your sibling's paw
Uncle Tom, please don't make my sentence long
Granted what I did was wrong
Pigs don't show remorse if you admit it all
Missing ma, hope that she don't miss the call
Admitted that she'll never visit
Like the hard headed never listen, Lord
So tell me how the fuck I'm supposed to eat?
If the richer's getting richer, the poor's growing weak
My brother died up in the streets, may he rest in peace
Niggas got heat like Pusha T, get it cheap
Flacko how you been, where you at? I've been kickin' back
Relax place down my favorite thinking cap, scratch my nigga neck
Hitta chit and chat, this and that, A$Ap diplomats
I'm missing Max, wish that they could bring the nigga Bigga back

[Hook: Joe Fox]
I wonder, laying in my bed
Am I still too young, am I still too young?
And I hold back, thoughts running through my head
Did I fuck it up, did I fuck it up?

[Verse 2: A$Ap Rocky]
It's like I lace up my boots and call my troops lately
Traded all my hoodie rap for all my suits lately
I'm 26 but I've been living in my youth lately
Pull my wisdom, but I still spit it like my tooth ache me
Duck shots, mother fuck cops, what's up blood clots?
All I gots my words and my balls and my one cock
Pause, buckshots fly, my young buck died
Passed away from a stray, from some fake tough guy
Now this the kind of story that should make doves cry
Fuck that, this the story that should make thugs cry
Dry your eyes older sis, held 'em close, watch 'em twitch
Gave 'em kiss in the midst of all of this
Ain't too late to pause or skip

Some day, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
Someday soon your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of these good old days

I was thinking about the band
I was thinking about the fans
We were underground
Loaded merch in that 12-passenger van
In a small club in Minnesota
And the snow outside of 1st Ave
I just wanted my name in a star
Now look at where we at
Still growing up
Still growing up
I'd be laying in my bed and dream about what I'd become
Couldn't wait to get older
Couldn't wait to be someone
Now that I'm here, wishing I was still young
Those good old days

I wish somebody would have told me babe
That some day these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
'Cause someday soon your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of the good old days

Wish I didn't think I had the answers
Wish I didn't drink all of that glass first
Wish I made it to homecoming
Got up the courage to ask her
Wish I would've gotten out of my shell
Wish I put the bottle back on that shelf
Wish I wouldn't have worry about what other people thought
And felt comfortable in myself
Rooftop open and the stars above
Moment frozen, sneaking out, and falling in love
Me, you and that futon, we'd just begun
On the grass, dreaming, figuring out who I was
Those good old days

I wish somebody would have told me babe
That some day these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
'Cause someday soon your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of the good old days

Never thought we'd get old
Maybe we're still young
May we always look back and think it was better than it was
Maybe these are the moments
Maybe I've been missing what it's about
Been scared of the future, thinking about the past
While missing out on now
We've come so far, I guess I'm proud
And I ain't worried about the wrinkles around my smile
I've got some scars, I've been around
I've thrown some pain, I've seen some things, but I'm here now
Those good old days

You don't know
What you've got
Till it goes, till it's gone

When I tell you to settle

Talkin' about, I heard he swims with this chick on the beach

That was out with the tide but my love you impeached

Now you lookin' at the walls

Head in hand

Cold jonezin'

Ringing my house

Hanging up and imposing

25265,25265,Songs written for a son or daughter,Growing Up,Macklemore & Ryan Lewis,"They say boys don't cry
But your daddy shed a lot of tears
They say I should be a strong man
But baby, I'm still filled with fear
Sometimes I don't know who I am
Sometimes I question why I'm here
I just wanna be a good dad
Will I be? I have no idea
They say girls shouldn't be tough
And moms should raise their kids at home
But baby, I know that that isn't true
Cause your momma's the toughest person I know
I wanna raise you to be like her
And watch you show the world how to do it on your own
I'm still tryna figure out who I am
I don't wanna mess this up or do this wrong
I'm gonna be there for your first breath
I don't know if I'll be there for your first step
I can promise you that I'll try to work less
But the tour's routed, and I got this album
Put in so many hours, and I just want the outcome
To be something that I can look back and I can be proud of
Don't wanna be a dad that's living in Facetime
But I've got a world to sing to and you at the same time
I won't spoil you, you can trust that
For your sweet 16, you get a bus pass
Had your heart broken? Been there, done that
I love you and I can't give you enough of that
Get back to community that raised you up
Read Langston Hughes, I suggest ""A Raisin in the Sun""
Listen to Sam Cooke, a change gon' come
You put the work in, don't worry about the praise, my love
Don't try to change the world, find something that you love
And do it every day
Do that for the rest of your life
And eventually, the world will change

I'll be patient, one more month
You'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
Times are changing, I know, but who am I if
I'm the person you become
If I'm still growing up, up, up, up
If I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up

I recommend that you read The Alchemist
Listen to your teachers, but cheat in calculus
Tell the truth, regardless of the consequence
And every day, give your momma a compliment
Take your girl to the prom
But don't get too drunk hanging out the limo
Slow dance with your woman in your arms
Sneak her in after but boy, you better tiptoe
Don't wake your mom up, do yoga, learn 'bout karma
Find God, but leave the dogma
The quickest way to happiness? Learning to be selfless
Ask more questions, talk about yourself less
Study David Bowie, James Bowen and 2pac
Watch the sun set with best friends from a rooftop
Wear a helmet, don't be stupid
Jaywalk, but look before you do it
If it snows, go outside, build a jump, get some help
Get a sled, thrash the hill with your friends till it melts
Go to festivals, camp, fall in love and dance
You're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance
Take risks, cause life moves so fast
You're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance

I'll be patient, one more month
You'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
Times are changing, I know, but who am I if
I'm the person you become
 I'm still growing up, up, up, up
If I'm still growing up, up,

I'll be patient, one more month
You'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
Times are changing, I know, but who am I if
I'm the person you become

Hey, Miley
Look, I know it sounds scrambled
When I'm singing it with you
But do a little bit better
At least, I may not get it all the way through
'Cause I'm not sure of the structure without you

Thinkin of you will make me smile
You never bother me with responsibility
Misbehaving in candlelight

Trust you to get caught up in somebody's war
You'll come out of it all in time, I'm sure

This land is mine, God gave this land to me 
This brave, this golden land to me 
And when the morning sun reveals her hills and plains 
Then I see a land where children can run free 

So take my hand and walk this land with me 
And walk this lovely land with me 
Though I am just a man, when you are by my side 
With the help of God, I know I can be strong

No father, no master
A shadow in silence
Left searching for answers

Put up for adoption
And left with no option
Another kid fostered
To fester forgotten

Take a look into these desperate eyes
As they're cast into the wretched hive

But I ain't going down alone

Anybody listening to me?
Is anybody else scared?
The paranoia, drops me to my knees
Does anybody feel lonely?
Disconnected from the things I see
Is there anybody out there?
Anybody out there just like me?

Now I stand as a father
To men with no honor
Ashamed of the racists
I used to call brothers

Cause no flag can mean bravery
When bloodied by slavery
The rebel, a devil, disguised as a savior

And the sickening feeling in the air
Is the fear to speak that no one dares

So will I stand here all alone?
Is there anybody out there?

Fear, fear's a powerful thing
I mean it's got a lot of firepower
If you can figure out a way to wrestle that fear
to push you from behind rather than to stand in front of you
that's very powerful. I always felt
that I had to work harder than the next guy
just to do as well as the next guy
And to do better than the next guy
I had to just kill. And you know, to a certain extent
that's still with me in how I work, you know, I just... go in

Sittin' 'bout a hundred stories up, like what the fuck?
And I'm just lookin' at it all
I'll be right here in Los Angeles

Goin' up, but shit, I feel the love

only showed me crime and violence

I had a dream that we was at peace
But I was so wrong... so wrong
Y'all too wrapped up in the bullshit and bias

Some of these hoes give less than a fuck
when they runnin' their life story by us

Some of these housewives way too fuckin' desperate

Shit it's just somethin' about that Hollywood curse

Alive but the war is here to stay
So my love catherina and me
Decide to take our last walk thru the noise to the sea
Not to die but to be reborn
Away from the lands so battered and torn
Forever forever

Oh say can you see it's really such a mess
Every inch of earth is a fighting nest
Giant pencil and lipstick-tube shaped things
Continue to rain and cause screamin' pain
And the arctic stains from silver blue to bloody red
As our feet find the sand
And the sea is straight ahad
Straight up ahead

Well it's too bad that our friends can't be with us today
Well it's too bad
The machine that we built
Would never save us that's what they say
That's why they ain't comin' with us today
And they also said it's impossible
For a man to live and breathe underwater
Forever was a main complaint
Yeah and they also threw this in my face they said
Anyway you know good and well
It would be beyond the will of god
And the grace of the king
Grace of the king
Yeah

Ooo

So my darling and I make love in the sand
To salute the last moment ever on dry land
Our machine it has done its work played its part well
Without a scratch on our body when we bid it farewell
Starfish and giant foams greet us with a smile
Before our heads go under we take our last look at the killing noise
Of the out of style
The out of style out of style oh yeah
Oooo

So down and down and down and down we go
Hurry my darlin' we mustn't be late

Could've been one of ours

Eh
I got a question for the ladies out there, yea
Cause there's a few things that I would like to know
Before I fuck with you

Oh baby
Could you learn?
Could you learn to love a troubled man? yea eh
Oh baby
Could you learn?
Could you learn to love a troubled man? yea

You sure you wanna roll with me? I'm a complicated man
Live my life close to the edge, it ain't even safe to stand
Trouble man, always into something
Numb to the consequences, guess it's coming if it's coming
But so much shit they say that I can't do because I'm famous
Guess I should live in a bubble like these other entertainers
The danger's so enticing to me, I don't even notice it
Guess I get away or get arrested 'fore it's over with
Prison sentence every year, got everybody after me
Reaper on my heels, I'm just praying he don't catch a g
Imagine me and you, somewhere happy 
With a few hundred mills
Sill I could go to jail for some years
Cause I push it to the limit, the danger's so exciting
I?m loving every minute, girl this life ain't nothing like it
And you only live once so as long as I'm alive
I be living on the edge, shorty sure you wanna ride?

Oh baby
Could you learn?
Could you learn to love a troubled man? yea eh
Oh baby
Could you learn?
Could you learn to love a troubled man? yea
Ay ay ay
Aye, they say if the drugs ain't the death of me, 
The lifestyle will be
Law keep arresting me, sucka wanna kill me
Still we in the fast lane, grind break, next speed
A million dollar sports car, smoking on the best weed
Fist fights in night clubs for rap beefs
Shootings, retaliations, yes that deed
I guess they just got to catch me when they catch me
Because I'm putting it in they life 
If they attempt to disrespect me
Especially when I know they say 
What go around come around
That?s why when we go around I keep a gun around
Cause bullshit, there be none around here
But I got a secret though, I wanna change  I swear
But suckas won't let me and feds still sweat me
So I'm looking for the worst 
To have you praying for the best
Think you can help me if they get me? 
Could you handle shit for me?
Think about it, is your body sure the answer assuming me

Oh baby
Could you learn?
Could you learn to love a troubled man? yea eh
Oh baby
Could you learn?
Could you learn to love a troubled man? yea

Girl would you give me your number? (tell the truth)
If I had an ok car, not much money
9 To 5, with a future on me oh
Tell me would you ever fuck with a brother like me? 
(woud you?)
If I did time in my life, time in my life
Time in my life, time in my life
Tell me could you give your sex to me? (I really wanna know)
If I was fightin in the club, fightin in the club
Fightin in the club, fightin in the club

Hey baby!
Could you learn? (put your hands up)
Learn to love a troubled man
(if you got a drink I need you to put that in the air as well, ok?)
Hey baby
Could you learn?
Could you learn to love a troubled man? yea eh

I know what it's like
To want it all, I was born to ball
Making Lamborghini engine sounds pedaling my bike
Lusted at luxury life since a tyke
Switches on a Monte Carlo turn a car into a trike
These images was burned in my mind
Chasing that paper like it stole something of mine
It did though, friends killed over small bills
I still go, hard spitting bars for them folk
Life so fragile
But the big bucks lay down the road less travelled
Cause they scared of the hazards
We living for the money, nigga we dying to have it
These hoes shaking asses doing lines
Popping valiums adding to a long list of bad habits
Niggas murdering, burglaring and kidnapping
Dashing and cashing all in the midst of the madness

[Hook: Pharrell]
I know
I was there so I seen and I did what you up to
I know you're chasing the paper (my nigga)
I know that scared but it's there and the girls wanna fuck you
I know you're chasing that paper (you're chasing that paper)

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
I know what that it is
All I wanted was some rims
I had a couple girls
But I knew if I had some chrome, I could multiply them hoes by ten
Materialistic them bitches is kinda hypocritical though my nigga
Because we play the same games wit 'em
Guilty of it fuck it though
I'm lane switching with no roof like a house when a tornado hit it
No kidding this world ain't Disney
These characters is after your pennies
Stack up can't go far with the dealings
Pimpin, back up, look at the whole picture and then see if it add up
I ain't no mathematician but I can count
On the jets fetching a very large amount
Racks on, racks on racks
Stretch marks on my account
I know how you feel I'm still feeling it now

[Hook: Pharrell]

Grandma would kiss my face
Wish I could go back there again
I'd climb up in my Grandpa's lap
I'd lay down and take a nap
That old man and me were best friends

And one day I turned around
Leaves are fallin', fallin' down
Those fields were bare and brown
And they were gone

Long gone like bluebonnets in the spring
We're only here for a little while
It's beautiful and bittersweet
So make the most of every mile
So pack like and love heavy
Give it all your heart and soul
So in the end you won't regret one thing

There's so much I can't explain
Such as gravity and pain
Still I remain, blindfolded and full of faith
I kissed my angel girl goodbye
Still can't help but wonder why
But I believe I'll see her again someday

So, hold 'em tender, hold 'em tight
Pray every mornin', day, and night
That God will help you raise them right
And don't you blink, don't blink

So pack light and love heavy

Time is something you can't borrow
So love like there's no tomorrow

Two ends of time are neatly tied
A one-way street
She's walkin to the end of the line
And there she meets
The faces she keeps in her heart and mind

They say goodbye
Tomorrow, Wendy, you're going to die
Tomorrow, Wendy, you're going to die

Underneath
The chilly grey november sky
We can make-believe
That kennedy is still alive
We're shooting for the moon
And smiling, jackie's driving by

They say good try
Tomorrow, Wendy you're going to die
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die

I told the priest
Don't count on any second coming
God got his ass kicked
The first time he came down here slumming
He had the balls to come
The gall to die and then forgive us
No, I don't wonder why
I wonder what he thought it would get us

Hey, hey, goodbye
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die

Hey, hey, goodbye
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die

Only god says jump
So I set the time
Cause if he ever saw it
It was through these eyes of mine
And if he ever suffered
It was me who did his crying

Hey, hey, goodbye

I can see the city light
From where I stand on the top floor
And I'm not sure if I'm dead
I raise my hands to the clouds
To check if heaven is with me now
Cause the devil's in my bed

And she won't love me
Like she could
And she won't hold me
Like you would

I bid this city goodnight
And cover street lamps just like my eyes
When it's quiet I'll go

And say my sweetest goodbye
Under billboards are fast food and mobile phones

Cause they won't treat me
Like they should
Cause they don't need me
Like you would

And filled up with regret
Could you forgive me yet

Until I made some tender coin 
And then I met some ladies from Marin 

We took the highway to the one
Up the coast to catch some sun 
That left me with these blisters on my skin 

Don't know what I was on
But I think it grows in Oregon
So I kept on goin going on right through 

I drove into Seattle rain 
Fell in love then missed the train 
That could have took me right back home to you 
 
I've been high
I've been low
I've been yes and I've been oh hell no! 
I've been rock 'n roll and disco
Won't you save me San Francisco? 

Uuuhhh ooohh
Uuuhhh ooohh

Every day so caffeinated 
I wish they were golden gated 
Fillmore couldn't feel more miles away

So wrap me up return to sender 
Let's forget this five year bender 
Take me to my city by the Bay! 

I never knew all that I had
Now Alcatraz don't sound so bad 
At least they have a hella fine Merleau 

If I could wish upon a star 
I would hitch a cable car 
To the place that I can always call my own! 

I've been high

I've been up

I've been so damn lost since you're not around 
I been reggae and calypso 
Won't you save me San Francisco? 

To tell you the truth 
I miss everything, everything 
It's a wild, wild beautiful world 
But there's a wide eyed girl back there 
And she means everything, everything

You bogus in the lambo if you ain't lifting the door up
You bogus poppin' pills if you ain't pickin the ho up
You bogus running out on your kids my nigga grow up
For god's sake, like a wedding, cutting large cake
For large stakes let the hammer bang broad day
Ay, nevermind what the blogs say
This what my mind and my heart say
My philosophy profit off of my properties
Get it, flip it, we got to be rich, that broke shit is obsolete
Possibly off of my rocker, watch how you watching me
Sophisticated, psychotic, fly as a pilot
Officially silent, all you wish you could get I got it
Unlimited titanium nigga, what's in yo wallet?
Out of gladiator college, I made it summa cum laude
While you clowns 
Couldn't have got a cap and gown if you bought it
I parlay with saudis, buying crude oil and diamonds
Hustle january, july, fly to dubai
A broke nigga telling me 'bout how I'm dividing the pies
Like a blind nigga telling me it's an eye for an eye
Bullheaded and stubborn I be that way until I die
But find a nigga with more hustle then me I dare you to try
And according to the hand on my audemar
It's my time to shine so fuck ya'll

What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to
(?) can't please everybody
You can't please everybody
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to

I grew up in the gutter, life a motherfucker
I get that why I don't trust a motherfucker
Seen a nigga snitch on they mom, shoot at they brother
Go to prison in love with a bitch and a nigga fuck her
I seen real g's destroyed by real suckers
Innocent ladies raped and defenseless babies abducted
Such a horrible truth, but you see it over and over
It's nothing, you numb to it and your heart grow colder
Pacify your pain with a chain and a rover
Fuck it, justify your action by stacking your dough up
You show up with a brick of cocaine and baking soda
Just enough for me to blow up, nigga hold up
Switch the flow up, cause these niggas be snitchin' so much
I promise all they missing's the badge, coffee, and donut
Go to jail so what, never see my integrity perish
That ain't the harris' way, study my pedigree
Promise I'm one of the only ones who keep it 100
Probably why I think they all out to get me, 
You can't convince me
Large money and fame will plant seeds of envy
To make my partners resent me enough 
To come and get me
Catch me slippin' and hit me, just like they did 50
Cause I'm in the position that he think he should be given
Listen, dawg, the fact of the matter is
I'm on a narrow path and we all can't travel


What it ain't, what it is?
Even if you gotta live
I learned that apartment is way more exciting 
Than a big ass house on a hill
I used to be a way better writer and a rapper
When I used to want a black karmann ghia
Now a nigga speeding in a porsche
Feeling like I'm going off a course
Cut these fuck niggas off
Nigga tip in my life scream that till I'm horse
Duck these get the fuck off me projectiles, 
Bitch you ain't really got a choice
I'm living my life live yours
I don't even like rapping fast
But that's how the word come to me talk to me 
Sideways nigga that's your ass
Slow it down, this that shit that'll make you call your momma
Say hey I'm sorry for begging for all them clothes 
You couldn't afford
And this the type of shit 
That'll make you call your rap partner
And say I'm sorry I'm awkward, 
My fault for fuckin' up the tours
I hated all the attention so I ran from it
Fuck it if we did, but I hope we ain't lose no fans from it
I'm a grown-ass kid, you know 
Ain't never cared about no damn money
Why do we try so hard to be stars, just to dodge comets
And this that shit that'll make you call your baby mama
When you gone on half a pill, don't know why but that I did
Then you take a flight back to the crib, 
Y'all make love like college kids
And you say all the shit you gon' do better, 
We can try this shit again
'round the time the dope wear off, you feel stupid
She feel lost
That's that dopamine, 
I mean dopamine you think you could done?
Waiting in the hallway with her arms crossed
Her baby boy face full of applesauce
Maybe should have stayed but it ain't yo fault
Too much pressure, I fell off, I'm sorry
Too strong and had to choose between you
And what the rest of the world might offer me, 
Shit what would you do
Well I'd probably do it differently if second the chance
Only if some cool ass older man 
Would've let me know in advance
This, this quarry, that is dug so deep in a father's chest
When he feel that he's broken up his nest
And he figured shit he was just doing the best that he could
Which end up being the worst that he could
And all some pussy 
Nigga on the internet can say is that verse ain't good
It's boring - boring?
Really?

When I'm disgusted with this world 
And I can hardly breathe and
Told so many lies, don't know what to believe
I discussed it with this girl, and this is what she said
She said lay down baby, baby, rest your weary head up
I love these distractions but my mind don't wanna rest
But my body disagree so I laid up on her breasts, yes

they will just say ' who are you'
Is that a question or not, and you see that the plot is predictible
not new. But you're still stunned at the things you will do.

No, No use in taking their time or in wasting two dimes
on a call to God knows who
When all you feel is the rain and it's hard to be vain
when no person looks at you. So just be gracious and wait
in the queue.

So when do I get to sing 'my way'
When do I get to feel like Sinatra felt
When do I get to sing 'my way' in heaven or hell
So when do I get to do it 'my way'
When do I get to feel like Sid Vicious felt
When do I get to sing 'my way' in heaven or hell

Yes, It's a tradition they say, like a bright christmas day
and traditions must go on.
And though I say yes I see, no I really don't see
is my smiley face still on?
Sign your name with an X, mow the lawn

CHORUS

They'll introduce me, Hello, Hello
Women seduce me and champagne flows
Then the lights go low, there's only one song I know

There, this home which once was serene, now is home to
the screams and to the flying plates and shoes.
But I have no souvenirs of these crackerjack years,
not a moment  I could choose, and not one offer that I
could refuse

Fear is crawling through the windows

A daughter who cares as much about the beautiful dresses
I give her as she cares about ME! ""

[Verse 1]
Let's do this for these babies
Mercedes truck, fuck, houses on acres
Blatantly ballin' on HD
Y'all need to step up y'all AV
Life changed again I was already taking off
My flight changed again
Slight change of winds
It's barely 12 noon and my wife changed again
Baby need Pampers
Daddy need at least three weeks in the Hamptons
Please don't judge me, only hugged the block
I thought my daddy didn't love me
My baby getting chubby
Cue that Stevie Wonder music, aww isn't she lovely
Now I'm staring at praying that things don't get ugly
And I'm stuck in that old cycle like wife leaves hubby
Fuck joint custody
I need a joint right now
Just the thought alone fucks with me

High on life
I could die from the fall
Imagine if I hit the floor
Apologies in order
To Blue Ivy my daughter
If it was up to me

This ain't my first time at the rodeo. ""

(Rum and whiskey) what a set off (what a set off)
And I know I'm not perfect baby
I been through so much trauma
It gonna be hard to reverse it
With some doctors and some nurses maybe
Teach me on how to treat a lady
Open doors on the 'Cedes
This relationship shit is complicated
All I know is we ain't speaking everyday
I fucking hate it
I don't wanna duplicate it
I seen my mom and pop
drive each other motherfuckin' crazy
And I got that nigga blood in me
I got his ego and his temper
All is missing is the drugs in me

Father never taught me how to be a father, treat a mother
I don't wanna have to just repeat another leave another
Baby with no daddy want no mama drama
I just wanna take her back to a time
when everything was calmer
Out in Paris on a terrace watching the Eiffel Tower
And a Ferris wheel yet and still, nothing could prepare us
For the beauty that you be Blue be
Looking in your eyes is like a mirror, have to face my fears
Cheer up, why can't you just be happy
Without these back and forth thoughts
you too much like your daddy
Badly I just wanna spent more time with him
Sadly life wouldn't let me get around with him
Now I got my own daughter
taught her how to take her first steps
Cut the cord watch her take her first breath
And I'm trying and I'm lying if I said I wasn't scared
But in life and death if I ain't here

I believe that's love 

I believe love, love 



uh of the things we believe 
there's a whole lot of work we should roll up our sleeves 
and we got a hold firm when fate's full like a sieve 
why doubt your plans cause when its all worth believing 
we can make it work do believe that 
we've mistrust in the dust and believe fact 
we can achieve tact 
by tuning out negative feedback 
naysayers can hate we concentrate to bring belief back 
into ourselves into the world into the rap game 
emcees are miserable that means their music's leaving mikes maimed
man look we holding down for the truth 
if we alone in the loop we gone hold for the proof 
man put it in believing 
believe in believing 
seeing ain't believing its the feeling that we needing 
believe in each other put the question to the system 
they promising returns then question what you getting 
we should believe in the reasons we existing 
time for renaissance to reawaken what is with it 
belief can confirm make it is what it isn't 
sometimes i wish i had belief when i didn't 

I believe that's love 

I believe that's love 

that's love 

in the land of make belief time to make unbelief believable 
take a belief to the realm of the real 
believe in this shit that's force fed through the medium 
believe it is real when it's really a raw deal 
never disbelieve when you see human miracle 
like ghetto children shining bright in babylon 
believe in that don't believe in stats to the contrary 
gotta be weary of them theories carry on 
people find belief when they don't find identity 
believe in your friends don't believe in your enemies 
mountains of doubts and disbeliefs right in front of you

Is the shit that's most appealing to you niggas
Even I fell victim to it, your pride don't let you do it
The lies will get you through it

Fronted my first brick over oxtails and ran with it
Dope is like a two-way street
The addiction, both you and me, now take a seat
Every car got a fleet, every broad get a jeep
Every sparkle in the club that wasn't ours, we compete
Poor minds, poor decision makers
No reward, then what's the risk you taking?

The dealers is washed, the money is dry, so take your best shot
We can't judge you 'cause we ain't hug you
We sent you off to other hoods and let them niggas fuck you
For real, we made you watch from afar
Even talked down on you, tryna dim your star
Until we seen them foreign cars pull up
And watch them pick you up
And then we realized we missed a diamond in the rough
So, make us proud, make it count
Until you learn to love 'em, make 'em spare no amount
Make 'em dig deeper to keep ya, knowing you deserve it
Take advantage of it when you're worth it

I'mma fix it like it's broken

Go to the mall, spend a lump sum
They could try to catch up to us
But they're too busy making assumptions

Is stay up all night losing sleep over you

Damn, I'm glad I strapped up
Ask her when she finish, if she came

She said ""I lapped ya twice""
Run it back for the door, rematch
Flip the crib when we fought, rematch
It get hot then no more, last cup
You can ask her if I fuck, she gassed, huh
I gotta keep it a secret, I keep a key in my lower pocket
Inside a register below the lower octave
Dirty laundry in my closet, they be strung out on the street
Left to dry with dry sheets and no deposit
They don't gotta worry, put my hand on your mouth
Put my hands in your mouth, girl
We got plans at my house, you know the way up

This thing we got is crazy
Only thing I know is you're my baby
Forever down, I am your lady
Always for sure, never a maybe
Never met someone who spoke my language
Never met a nigga done with playin'
You the type of nigga make me lane switch
Hand me the brush and say ""paint it""

Ain't nobody's hero, but I wanna be heard
on your Hot 9-7 everyday, that's my word
Swimmin in women wit they own condominiums

Five carats on my hands wit the cuts
And swim in European figures

Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's an old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I'll walk with my sweet Mary

Cold gray walls surround me
And I realize that I was only dreamin'
There's a guard and there's a sad old padre
Arm and arm we'll walk at daybreak

When you played me that song
Gave every word meaning
You showed me a place we belonged

And we laughed and we danced
and we never looked back
Nothing would get in our way
And you showed me the meaning of love and romance
With every song that you played

The music's too sad without you
The silence is all I can listen to now
I can't sing along to the songs like I used to
The music's too sad when you're not around

I remember that feeling

You felt like home
So why am I leaving?
Leaving you all alone

and we never looked back
Nothing would get in our way

The music's too sad without you
The silence is all I can listen to now
I can't sing along to the songs like I used to

Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Well, the walls are talking to me
and I know you think I'm wrong
But sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Now when the phone start to click in, your words start to echo
Say you got to hang up but the man won't let go
Oh, my nigga say it ain't so
Now we speaking on some niggas that he say he ain't know
We used to steal dirt bikes, dodge raindrops
So close niggas thought we had the same pops
Graduated, gettin' money on the same blocks
But things changed and we ain't end up in the same box
Hearing whispers, ""it ain't adding up""
Giving you the jailhouse talk but you ain't mad enough
I never thought I'd be the last man standing up
I never thought I'd had have to question
""Were you man enough? ""
Long letters how the streets got the best of you
Telling all your cellies how come I ain't sitting next to you
Yeah, see I can read between the lines
So it's awkward when you call and I gotta press 5

[Hook 2: Pharrell Williams]
Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
I think the Feds are looking through me
can't you hear it in my tone?
So then sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Got me tiptoeing through the conversation on our calls
Tryna act normal but the writing is on the wall
It's like I hear you smiling when you heard they hit the wall
But I just let it ride so I don't be the next to fall
""They sayin' Terrion been getting money while I'm gone
And won't he tryna to holla at my bitch when I was home""
""Nah, he selling cars, it'd be him and Lil Rome""
I'm just tryna offset what he was saying on my phone
Nowadays niggas don't need shovels to bury you
Pointing fingers like pallbearers how they carry you
So much for death before dishonor
Might as well have a robe and gavel like your honor
I just sit and wonder, play it by the numbers
When you ride like lightning then you crash like thunder
Seen your baby mama
she ain't even know if she should speak
What the fuck is there to say
knowing her king's now weak saying

Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Well, the walls are talking to me

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Let's talk real niggas, let's speak real, nigga
How many niggas you knew snitching you ain't killed, nigga?
Covered his own tracks, he didn't care that
We had a legacy he killed, I got to wear that
Every move we ever made is getting stared at
I bet the man inside his mirror doesn't stare back
Break your heart when the man you call your brother
Be the same one that setting in motion all them undercovers
Called my mom mother, was at my graduation
When I signed my record deal you was my motivation
Uh, from great friends now it's no affiliation
Divided by the time he was facing, once he told me that

I hate to find you like this
I always find you like this
I come home and clean up your mess
What would you do without that?
Why do I always come back?
Oh, what I wouldn't do for you

And I'm starting to think 
that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm starting to think 
that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

Some nights I want to run for the hills
It's never easy with you
I cannot reason with you
But your smile is as rare as it comes
What would I do without that
Maybe that's why I come back
Oh, what I wouldn't do for you

And I'm starting to think 
that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm starting to think 
that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

Starting to think we were made
for each other
But one of us in this relationship 
is raising the other
You remind me of my mother
We drive one another crazy as each other
And we're both adults so there's 
no excuse for the games 
that we play with each other
Where you at? At a friend's?
No, you ain't, motherfucker
But I give her the benefit of the doubt
Whenever the doubt kicks in, shiver
When I touch her,
'cause I love her so much, I'm a sucker

Our bottom lip can quiver
when she's in trouble,
she's in hot water
Think I caught her cheating again
Give her another chance? 
Another one after that?
I'm swimming in that Egyptian river, 
'cause I'm in denial
Say I don't eat shit, 
but I got a shit-eating grin 
when I smile
Making an excuse for us to act it out
She's just acting out, with her inner child
Then I set the truth on fire
Cause I'd rather believe a lie then
I breathe a sigh of relieve that 
I don't believe in
Going to bed mad
I keep on trying 
to make a bad girl good
But haven't I stood by you in good times?
And bad? 
I'm starting to feel like 
your god damn dad
'Cause I literally 
feel like you could die 
""Should I leave me for good?"" 
You never would
It'd be all bad
Never understood why they call it goodbye
But I think I'm a pretty damn good guy
And you're a good person, too
I can save you, I can make you change
But I keep putting my fucking foot in my mouth
Every time I gotta come and bail you out
When you get in trouble that you get yourself in
And I'm in trouble but I can't leave
I'll sell you out! 
I could never turn my fuckin' back on you
What is that?
I'm co-dependent, I'm just now noticing it
But somehow it's like every time 
I'm about to go to end it
I ain't got the cojones to do it
Nor the heart,
our apartment's tore apart
You're using my heart for a dart board
But God must've aligned stars for us
'Cause somebody paired us up
And they say he ain't 
capable of making a mistake
But this one's perfect
'Cause I'm...

Take things in stride
Sounds like good advice
But there's no one at my side

And time washes clean
Love's wounds unseen
That's what someone told me
But I don't know what it means

'Cause I've done everything I know
To try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna love you
For a long, long time

Caught in my fears
Blinking back the tears
I can't say you hurt me

And I never drew
One response from you
All the while you fell
All over girls you never knew

'Cause I've done everything I know
To try and make you mine
And I think it's going to hurt me
For a long, long time

Wait for the day
You'll go away
Knowing that you warned me
Of the price I'd have to pay

And life's full of flaws
Who knows the cause?
Living in the memory
Of a love that never was

What a lovely seventy-fifth 
We watched the party on TV 
You seemed to be 
Taking things casually 
What a mighty heart 
Must beat in your breast 
To hold forty-nine medals on your chest 
Think of all the gifts that you've got 
Some were acquired and some were not 
Like a natural talent for marionettes 
Who do your dirty work and cover your bets 
So with one hand waving free 
The other one crushed a budding democracy 

Congratulations, Jaruzelski 
What a wonderful job you have done 
Let me mention to a sane man's eye 
You've lost the meaning of compromise 
They're comparing you 
To General Pinochet 
It's a dubious compliment at best 
Your people are freezing 
The workers are bleeding 
You've already 
Arranged numerous deaths 
The only difference in the camps 
From the stadiums 
Is not much 
For the doomed all cry 
It's only the weather 
And the songs people sing 
Just before they die 

Do you hear us, Lech Walesa? 
What a terrible price you have paid 
For being ahead of your time 
Has surely constituted a crime 
Oh, Mr. Brezhnev, look 
Somebody read the little red book 
And took it all seriously 
The way you did 
When you were young and you believed 
And you workers and you black Madonna 
You're not supposed to utter a word 
But the courage of you 
And your man of the year 
Is a symphony the world 
Has seldom seen or heard 
Through the Siberian gates of hell 
The Pope and the bishops 
Are wishing you well 
We see your candles in the park 
Hear your fearless promises in the dark 
How they cheat and when tried to win 
They didn't know that there 
Would always be within you 
And we hear you, Lech Walesa 
Yes, we hear you, Lech Walesa

Workin' your fingers right down to the bone
And the guy behind you won't leave you alone

You're fortunate if you have time to eat
Back in the classroom open you books
Gee but the teacher don't know
How mean she looks

You finally lay your burden down
Close up your books, get out of your seat

Right to the juke joint you go in

25709,25709,Songs about war,"Where Are You Now, My Son?",Joan Baez,"(Words and Music by Joan Baez) 

It's walking to the battleground that always makes me cry 
I've met so few folks in my time who weren't afraid to die 
But dawn bleeds with the people here and morning skies are red 
As young girls load up bicycles with flowers for the dead 

An aging woman picks along the craters and the rubble 
A piece of cloth, a bit of shoe, a whole lifetime of trouble 
A sobbing chant comes from her throat and splits the morning air 
The single son she had last night is buried under her 

They say that the war is done 
Where are you now, my son? 

An old man with unsteady gait and beard of ancient white 
Bent to the ground with arms outstretched faltering in his plight 
I took his hand to steady him, he stood and did not turn 
But smiled and wept and bowed and mumbled softly, ""Danke shoen"" 

The children on the roadsides of the villages and towns 
Would stand around us laughing as we stood like giant clowns 
The mourning bands told whom they'd lost by last night's phantom messenger 
And they spoke their only words in English, ""Johnson, Nixon, Kissinger"" 

Now that the war's being won 
Where are you now, my son? 

The siren gives a running break to those who live in town 
Take the children and the blankets to the concrete underground 
Sometimes we'd sing and joke and paint bright pictures on the wall 
And wonder if we would die well and if we'd loved at all 

The helmetless defiant ones sit on the curb and stare 
At tracers flashing through the sky and planes bursting in air 
But way out in the villages no warning comes before a blast 
That means a sleeping child will never make it to the door 

The days of our youth were fun 
Where are you now, my son? 

From the distant cabins in the sky where no man hears the sound 
Of death on earth from his own bombs, six pilots were shot down 
Next day six hulking bandaged men were dazzled by a room 
Of newsmen. Sally keep the faith, let's hope this war ends soon 

In a damaged prison camp where they no longer had command 
They shook their heads, what irony, we thought peace was at hand 
The preacher read a Christmas prayer and the men kneeled on the ground 
Then sheepishly asked me to sing ""They Drove Old Dixie Down"" 

Yours was the righteous gun 
Where are you now, my son? 

We gathered in the lobby celebrating Chrismas Eve 
The French, the Poles, the Indians, Cubans and Vietnamese 
The tiny tree our host had fixed sweetened familiar psalms 
But the most sacred of Christmas prayers was shattered by the bombs 

So back into the shelter where two lovely women rose 
And with a brilliance and a fierceness and a gentleness which froze 
The rest of us to silence as their voices soared with joy 
Outshining every bomb that fell that night upon Hanoi 

With bravery we have sun 
But where are you now, my son? 

Oh people of the shelters what a gift you've given me 
To smile at me and quietly let me share your agony 
And I can only bow in utter humbleness and ask 
Forgiveness and forgiveness for the things we've brought to pass 

The black pyjama'd culture that we tried to kill with pellet holes 
And rows of tiny coffins we've paid for with our souls 
Have built a spirit seldom seen in women and in men 
And the white flower of Bac Mai will surely blossom once again 

I've heard that the war is done 
Then where are you now, my son?

In the night I see the sign - six miles to stull
Forty miles west of Kansas City
She said that she had come in white to meet me
I see Sharon and I see Jack
It's me and roman weared in black,
Tell my bride to bury me in stull...

I belong to the laws and crew
You see we fought and we get happy
That's the way we push them through
Oh
(Have you been tried-)

[Fredo:]
Have you been tried in that fire?
I heard bullets sing higher than Mariah in choir
Spent a lot of time trappin', now I'm tryna retire
But the shit runs in my blood, and I'm the guy they require
And these guns bring nothin' but prison and death, still
All my niggas just admire the fire
Bro squeeze and he miss, but we admire a trier
Finesse king, you can never lie to a liar
But Fred got the fire, I fire for days
I gotta write them in my notes, they be ignitin' the page
Grindin' on cold nights, puttin' light to the flame
Now there's no flame that can melt the ice in my chain, yeah
I really put the ice in rice for the 'caine
Me and Santan, you won't see nothin' like this again
That's my young boys again, on the glide with the flame
I just really hope your block came with fire-escapes

[Meekz:]
Before my entrance, I took the fire exit
Tried and tested, about twenty times arrested
Two times guilty, no comment, I guess they guessed it
Couple time bail, no forensics
This a easy pendant, I don't need a necklace
We stay protected and connected
It's the energies I'm blessed with
And now they watchin' like Netflix, had me doin' next shit
Tryna get rich, but what's rich?
Took more losses than Boris
I sold more boxes than the post-office
Twenty-one in jail, it turned me so solid
Why you think my vision sick
I changed the game in my brain
And sold robotics
If you fell in my fire, you probably roast on it
Heat on the stove, I put hope on it
Cah they don't care 'bout our lives, I put my soul on it
I'm done tryna be somebody to some nobodies
I'm bein' so honest, and they don't know porridge

[Ghetts:]
If I get burned while I'm watchin', higher learnin'
Guns bustin', tyres turnin', that's a Russian and a German
That's your phone ringin', you can hear the beep
You won't be saved by the bell when you hear the screech
And it's so deep, open, ocean
This man escapin' some shells they can barely see
Me and bro raisin' hell, we gon' share the heat
Now put us in the same cell, we gon' share the sleep
I'm my brothers keeper (It's deeper)
I'm my brothers leader (Speaker)
I'm the eldest
The one who had to make a name so the bells ring
So nobody would trouble my siblings in this whirlwind
My older cousin wasn't known for nothin'
Never had no one I could call, but I was old in somethin'
I'm diggin' deep with tool like I'm known for plumbin'
Somethin' in your chest like it's robatussin
Word to arsonist, I burn all this
I stood in front of all three dragons and heard ""Dracarys""
And now we're jumpin' out G-Wagons and murkin' parties
Man are comin' out with bangers and dirty dancin'
Nobody puts baby in a corner
I uplift my girl, like I'm Swayze in the water
And if it's already written, maybe I'm the author
So accustomed to the fire
I get shivers when I'm naked in the sauna
How, many times have they mistaken me for Scorcher?
I'm lookin' in the mirror, sayin' ""Justin, just cool, huh""
Send Ghetts downstairs and tell them ""Just bring me water""
And tell Ghetts I put somethin' in the formula
I'm focused, I don't need to burn the kush
This is Moses speakin' to the burnin' bush
I stood in front of the fire and learned to cook
Finished my verse and never heard a hook

And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic

All wanna see me with no pot to piss in

Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions:
Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months
they had a nigga locked up

No, a small town don't like it when a cowboy has feelings for men

And I believe in my soul that inside every man there's a feminine
And inside every lady there's a deep manly voice loud and clear
Well, a cowboy may brag about things that he does with his women
But the ones who brag loudest are the ones that are most likely queer

Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other
Say what did you think those saddles and boots was about? 
And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his brother, 
And inside every cowboy there's a lady that'd love to slip out
 
And there's always somebody who says what the others just whisper
And mostly that someone's the first one to get shot down dead
So when you talk to a cowboy don't treat him like he was a sister

Recently she even seems to hate on all my songs
Deleted my pictures took my face up out her phone
Where did we go wrong I'm sitting here thinkin'
She said the weed too strong, it keeps my breath stinkin'
Dizzy high, I ride away in my Lincoln
Close my eyes and fly away but no blinking
I'm just dreaming she ain't really screaming
It goes both ways and I was trying to get even
Lost my whole evening mostly for no reason and
Just my broken weaslin', now I'm trying to ease it in
Came home late I just put the key in
It would probably be straight if she was european
She's not she's hot and mad as she can be
If you can hate on anybody girl I'm glad it was me

She hates me, I know it for sure
But I'm a make her love me
I'm a make her love me again

Make a few plans like you wanna go where I'm a go?
Well let's leave pronto and that's what we did
Then we yelled out geronimo and jumped off that bridge
Had a couple kids, you can move where I live
I know old ass niggas that's scared to do what I did
The shoe still fits but I'm wearing out the sole
Sometimes I really feel as if I'm burning out my soul
I should have a lot, been preparing for my show
But instead everybody keeps dick riding my flow
Now I know I ain't white bitch, but bitch I ain't broke

Stabbing on your heart again
Relationship ruined
I tried to change but I'm always out
Fucking around in the club
Pieces of my love letter tore up from this break up
My worst nightmare went right in my back
I wish I could wake up
I feel like shit, know I ain't shit but I'm

Baby I took advantage cause I knew you
Wouldn't believe it, so I used you
I'm sorry, oh I'm sorry don't make it right, I know

Life's short, baby girl you deserve a winner
Every day the diamonds on you get bigger and bigger
Hustle from my heart
So every night I can deliver
Saying sorry, laying up, way up in your liver
Boss, the red bottom's got you walking funny
Get you an agent, she balling and all she talk is money
Take you shopping, baby boy ain't no salary caps
She get it popping so you better bring battery packs
Perfect time to relax
Nothing is perfect other than me and the perfect match
They all watch me
Cause the moves I make out they budget
Diamond digits, six figures on my shorty nugget

I tried to change but they always around
Pulling me down in bed
Gave you my word but they were just broken promises
Broken condoms, lipstick marks and unprotected sex
I feel like shit, you know I ain't shit

Sorry, don't turn back the clock
Baby I took advantage cause I knew you
Wouldn't believe it, so I used you

Shout to everybody
Who's been on this trip with me
You don't have to agree
But if you feel like me

Someone get this aryan a sheet
Time to bury him, 
so tell him to prepare to get impeached
Everybody on your feet
This is where terrorism and
heroism meets, square up in the streets
This chump barely even sleeps
All he does is watch 
Fox News like a parrot and repeats
While he looks like a canary with a beak
Why you think banned 
transgenders from the military with a tweet?
He's trying to divide us, 
this shit's like a cult
But like Johnny, he'll only unite us
'Cuz nothing drives us inside 
like this fight does
Similar to when two cars collide 
'cause our spirits are crushed
This spot's a tight one
But here the jaws of life 
come to pull us from the wreckage
That's what we get pride from
When we can't wear stars and stripes 
'cause this type of pickle 
we're in is hard to deal
But there's always tomorrow still
If we start from the scratch 
like a scab for scars to heal
And band together for Charolettesville
And for Heather fallen heroes
Fill his wall with murals, Nevada get up
Hit the damn resetter, let's start from zero
This is our renewal, spray tan get ride of
Get a brand new, better, America
And here's to where we're from

This is where it all began, all began

way to get your hate off, Nazi

biggot, the swastika 
with your name carved in it
Should be your trademark, 
cause it's all you played off
And you just took the plate off,
so I guess it pays 
to feed off of chaos
So basically, you Adolf Hitler
But you ain't ruining our country, punk
You won't take our pride from us
You won't define us
'Cause like a dictionary,
 things are looking up
So much, got a sprained neck
Know we would rise up
Against this train wreck 
and take a stand
Even if it mean sitting 
when they raise the flag
This ain't the Star Spangled Banner
This man just praised 
a statue of General Lee, 'cause
He generally hates the black people, 
degrades hispanics
Take it back to the Shady national convention
Wish I would have spit on it 
before I went to shake his hand at the event
Or maybe had the wherewithal
To know that he was gonna 
try to tear apart a sacred land
We cherish and stand for, so

As they ride past in they patrol cars
So tell me why I feel like the enemy
They're supposed to be here protecting me
I might have went too far
Helping to contribute to making their job hard
Serving fiends like these people ain't no enemy
I can't believe I'm out here killing my community
If you knew how far I came
Where I am and where I used to be
I don't want it, you can tell by the look at me
This gangsta life ain't no longer in me

I know there's things I could've done a lot better
Instead, I'm in the streets trying to make that cheddar
Thinking in my mind that you gonna be there forever
I know I could've let it all go (let it all go)
But I was thinkin it would make life better (make life better)
Instead I'm sittin in this cell writin this letter
Thought I wouldn't get caught cause I was way too clever
I learned there's no one to catch ya when ya falling
And they'll be no one to hear you when you're calling
Do you know what it's like to wake up in the morning

Reminiscing on them days you was walking
With pretty women on your arm while you're flossing

Hey baby let's fly away to a private place
So far away we get high
And feel that we out of space
She keep looking back at it
We keep grinding like jack rabbits
All she want is this pipe
I turn her into a crack addict
Ain't nothing that a nigga can't afford
Louie, Gucci or Chanel, I'll buy the store
You and me on a new beach, sippin' champagne
Making love on a island resort
No need to pack luggage
Hope on the jet like ""fuck it""
I got everything you want and you need
I guarantee you'll love it
She the baddest woman you ever seen
She belong with King Magazine
You might seen her on a movie screen
She's so dope now I'm her fiend
Just thinking about her I don't need a buzz

We at the lake, she skinny dipping
In the hotel we wake the neighbors
They knocking like Jehovah's Witness

Out on my yaught we go island shopping
Back to my suit, ten grand a night
Just me and you, it's a private party
She's sent from heaven, mayne
She needs wings on her
I might have to put a ring on her
Damn she so bad, damn she so thick
I wonder how she fit jeans on it
For me she unleash her inner animal
When we meet
And she's a lady off in the streets
But a beast when we're in the sheets

So I said, ""Climb in, "" and in she climbed

Well, she was bruised and broke from head to toe
With a tear in her blood-stained shirt
She didn't tell the whole truth, but she didn't have to

I didn't load her down with questions

To a family that contradicts the concepts
Heard the rules, but wouldn't accept
And womenfolk raised me
And I was full-grown before I knew
I came from a broken home

Sent to live with my grandma down south
When my uncles was leaving
And my grandfather had just left for heaven
They said and as every-ologist would certainly note
I had no strong male figure, right?
But Lily Scott was absolutely not your mail-order, room-service
Typecast, black grandmother
I was moved in with her
Temporarily, just until things were patched
Till this was patched and till that was patched
Until I became at 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10
The patch that held Lily Scott who held me and like them four
I become one more and I loved her from the absolute marrow of my bones
And we was holdin' on
I come from a broken home

She had more than the five senses
She knew more than books could teach
And raised everyone she touched just a little bit higher
And all around her there was a natural sense
As though she sensed what the stars say, what the birds say
What the wind and and the clouds say
A sensual soul and self, that African sense
And she raised me like she raised four of her own
And I was hurt and scared and shocked when Lily Scott left
Suddenly one night
And they sent a limousine from heaven to take her to God
If there is one
So I knew she had gone
And I came from a broken home",aprox,200,On Coming From a Broken Home (Pt. 1)

High school she was that girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym 
(Just to get a peek again, shes a 10) 
Never thought she would come and work for the president 
Mr. George Washington (where my money at?) 
She thought he'd call (where my money at?) 
She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day 
All you wanna know is (where my money at?) 
Closed legs don't get fed, go out there and make my bread 
All you wanna know is (where my money at?) 
She ended up in a road car, bruised up, scarred hard 
All you wanna know is (where my money at?) 
She thought he'd call (where my money at?)

Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all(dollar, dollar bill y all) 

[Verse 2: (Akon)] 
Pimpin got harder cos hoes got smarter 
On the strip is something they don't wanna be a part of 
Rather be up in the club shakin for a thug 
For triple times the money and spending it like they wanna 
They got they mind on they money, money on they mind 
They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the nines 
See everyday they feel the struggle, but staying on they grind 
And ain't nobody takin from us, and that's the bottom line 
But I know, there's a drop in the block 
You move slow, you getting pressure from cops 
You don't know, not to lay low 
Because 25 to life's no joke 
To all my real gorillas thuggin 
On top of corners every day strugglin 
All the beautiful women gettin money 
Washin' them dollar bills like laundry

(Weezy) She used to be (she used to be the sweetest girl) 
She used to be the sweetest girl ever 
Now she like sour and Mcgregor 
She wears a dress to the T like the letter 
And if you make it rain she will be under the weather 
She used to run track back in high school 
Now she tricks off the track right by school 
She takes a loss cos she don't wanna see her child lose 
So respect her, I'll pay up for the time used 
And then she runs to the pastor 
And he tells her there will be a new chapter 
But she feels no different after 
And then she asks him (where my money at?)

I woke up in a Soho doorway
A policeman knew my name
He said ""You can go sleep at home tonight
If you can get up and walk away""

I staggered back to the underground
And the breeze blew back my hair
I remember throwin' punches around
And preachin' from my chair

chorus:
Well, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
I really wanna know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Tell me, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
'Cause I really wanna know (Who are you? Who, who, who?)

I took the tube back out of town
Back to the Rollin' Pin
I felt a little like a dying clown
With a streak of Rin Tin Tin

I stretched back and I hiccupped
And looked back on my busy day
Eleven hours in the Tin Pan
God, there's got to be another way

Well, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)

I know there's a place you walked
Where love falls from the trees
My heart is like a broken cup
I only feel right on my knees

I spit out like a sewer hole
Yet still recieve your kiss
How can I measure up to anyone now
After such a love as this?

And it was just the other day everything was so good
Living like yesterday we were chillin in the hood
Dreaming the bigger things that a younger niggas should
Wanna take care of the fam we just wishin that we could
Other day in the dollar stayin chasing the
Studios went for hours ..like a piranha
Only was... but loyalty with the honor
Grind round in the bubble for drama
Man I put that on my life that’s my motha f*cka dough
Anything I will... that’s the nigga I will call
Just don’t need come and running with that shit clear em all
Talking he play me and
Brothers turn like we ain’t done it all
They went then in the studio that’s when I got the cope
And it was all night when I lost ym dough till these days

No you watching from heaven now for you nigga came
So I tell you that you lane show you I’ll never change

Is just me and my niggas we’re runnin down memory lane
Got memory lane, talk about runnin down memory lane...

And I just gotta keep it real I’m telling you how I feel
Talking before the deal when I was back in the field
Nigga we used to chill let’s my nigga dale
And in the school let’s do it for a sale
We visit in this crib a couple days and we bale
In a couple of clubs and a couple of girls got damn my nigga
In the motha f*cker days lord just tell em
Why you had to take my dough
They just wanted this car, they just wanted to bowl
They just wanted to leave frightened by wha he saw
I was off in the room waiting my nigga call
When it’s the last time that we would even talk
I told em to be safe in the my dough
A acouple hours later got an unexpected call
My homie he was crying I knew that it was bad
He told me damn gone, you’re lying at your ass
I call it cell phone but nobody hit em back
They say that he was shot down to make it right
He died on the scene that’s when I hit my knees
Begging the lord please heavenly father please
So listen t the dream tell me how could it be
Probably because of me, my homie wanted to see
Then a couple years ago when I lost my dough

Hey baby you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-man
She remember my Sprinter, said ""I was in the grape van""
Uhm, well cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come Erykah Badu me, well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas
swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iphone cameras
This shit unanimous for you
it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me
I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, spin that round
and say the alphabet backwards
You're dealing with malpractice
don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just cause he a nerd
and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good though, the head still good though
Make me say ""Nam Myoho Renge Kyo""
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual
Make me believe in miracles
Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast
and booty cheek
The pop community
I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these
moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kicking in gratuity
And yeah G, I was all for it

Friday night tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat something pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury taste buds
And the Louis Vuitton store, got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only get hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preach it to the choir
Any rumor you heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowing the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em really
I remember Amber told my boy
no matter what happens she ain't going back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L. A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive
need to put up some god damn barricades
I be paranoid every time
The pressure, the problem ain't I be drivin'
The problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me
was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
I had my life threatened by best friends
who had selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans
I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans
who thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over, emcees cancel your plans
A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took 6 months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
God damn, got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressing like Cam, thank God for me
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neck full
Bitches say he funny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop it like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach
good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money, money, money, money
Big, big money, money, money, money
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker

Tell me, how is it gonna feel without my arms wrapped around, wrapped around you?
Bet it feels pretty real when your skin starts to peel from the bone
You were dead to the world, now I'm dead to you
Haunting your own house, nothing to lose
How did I let you sink your fangs so deep? Ah
You know you can't breathe on your own

Past the point of rescuing, why'd I keep pushing my luck?
The hole I wore into your soul has got too big to overlook
One day the only butterflies left will be in our chests
As we march towards our death, breathing our last breath
I thought we had a future, but we ain't got a chance in hell

So tell me, how is it gonna feel without my arms wrapped around, wrapped around you?

misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the same

If these walls could talk [x6]

[Anna Wise]
Sex, she just want to close her eyes and sway
If you, if you, if you 
exercise your right to work it out
Its true, its true, its true, 
shout out to the birthday girls say hey
Say hey, everyone deserves a night to play
And shes plays only when you tell her no

[Hook - Bilal]
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries 
gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I?m in it, 
I love it when I?m in it

[Verse 1]
If these walls could talk they?d tell me to swim good
No boat I float better than he would
No life jacket I?m not the guard in Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Wall telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them 
just to relieve tension
Me? I?m just a tenant
My lord said these walls 
vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean its still amazing 
before they couldn?t stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I?m here
These walls never could hold up
Everytime I come around demolition 
might crush

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
If these walls could talk they?d tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down that?s my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don?t know how long I can wait in these walls
I?ve been on these streets too long 
looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song 
about how they walls are always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must?ve missed them
I?m not involved I?d rather diss them
I?d rather call all you put your wall up
Cause when I come around demolition gon? crush

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
If your walls could talk 
they?d tell you it?s too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash them where they are
Take the recipe, the bible and god
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening no calling Co
No calling your mother to save you
Homies say to you, you're reputable, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy Da Bull 
like a killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping 
the warden could afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to ""Sing About Me""
Retaliation is strong you even dream about me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted the same night
So when you play this song 
rewind the first verse, about me abusing my power 
 so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you 
until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you 
when you asked her
And how she fucking on a famous rapper
Walls could talk

I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned 
into a deep depression

Hi
I'm your video DJ
I always talk like I'm wigged out on quaaludes
I wear a satin baseball jacket everywhere I go

My job is to help destroy
What's left of your imagination
By feeding you endless doses
Of sugar-coated mindless garbage

So don't create
Be sedate
Be a vegetable at home
And thwack on that dial
If we have our way even you will believe
This is the future of rock and roll

How far will you go
How low will you stoop
To tranquilize our minds with your sugar-coated swill

You've turned rock and roll rebellion
Into Pat Boone sedation
Making sure nothing's left to the imagination

But you've got a lot of nerve
To call yourself a pioneer
When you're too god-damn conservative
To take real chances.

Instead of music fans
Call all the shots at giant record companies now

Forget honesty
Forget creativity

Broken dreams, stolen freedom,
Trapped in the night, trafficked and beaten.
All a part of an evil economy, 
nothing more than someones commodity...
A precious being, like you and me, 
a daughter, a sister, a somebody!

She was drawn by the bright lights,
She was tied up in their lights,
She worked right through the daylight,
No voice, she's a slave to the night.

27 million, like me.
(that's 27 million on this cruel journey!)

(I wanna see you jumping! go!)

We've got to rise up, open our eyes up!
Be her voice, be her freedom,
Come on, stand up! x4
(rise up! x2)
(stand up!)

After the man left, she's nothing left,
No one, no love, no one to call her friend.
She's stuck in the pit of hell, she's almost sick from the smell.
She's numb, she's dead from the inside out,
Her heart is screaming but you don't hear the shout.
Who's the voice? who's going to break the door down?
Who wakes her up from the nightmare now?

She was drawn by the bright lights,
She was tied up in their lights,
She worked right through the daylight,
No voice, she's a slave to the night.

27 million, like me.
(that's 27 million that need heaven's mercy!)

(let's go!)

We've got to rise up, open our eyes up!
Be her voice, be her freedom,
Come on, stand up! x4
(stand up!)
(rise up! x2)

27 million, are you joking?
How do we let evil get so tight a grip?
Watching while the world falls apart, 
how do we let this stuff begin?
We're not bothered if this offends, 
'cause you got people that can defend.
But they ain't got that, they got nothing.
Sometimes you gotta stand for something,
Let this be the stand that gets your blood running!

Little girl don't cry,
Let me dry your eyes
In the darkest night.
(you're not alone.)
Hold on through the storm,
You're not on your own,
Hold on, love will come.

(let me hear you sing!)

We've got to rise up, open our eyes up!
Be her voice, be her freedom,
Come on, stand up! x8

To the man that waited on me
At the Starbucks down on Main
I hope you understand
When I put on that t-shirt
The only thing I meant to say
Is I'm a Skynyrd fan
The red flag on my chest somehow is
Like the elephant in the corner of the south
And I just walked him right in the room
Just a proud rebel son with an 'ol can of worms
Lookin' like I got a lot to learn
But from my point of view

[Chorus: Brad Paisley]
I'm just a white man coming to you from the Southland
Tryin' to understand what it's like not to be
I'm proud of where I'm from but not everything we've done
And it ain't like you and me can re-write history
Our generation didn't start this nation
We're still picking up the pieces, walking on eggshells, fighting over yesterday
And caught between Southern pride and Southern blame

[Verse 2: Brad Paisley]
They called it Reconstruction, fixed the buildings, dried some tears
We're still siftin' through the rubble after a hundred-fifty years
I try to put myself in your shoes and that's a good place to begin
But it ain't like I can walk a mile in someone else's skin

[Chorus: Brad Paisley]
Cause I'm a white man livin' in the southland
Just like you I'm more than what you see
I'm proud of where I'm from but not everything we've done
And it ain't like you and me can re-write history
Our generation didn't start this nation
And we're still paying for the mistakes
That a bunch of folks made long before we came
And caught somewhere between southern pride and southern blame

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
Dear Mr. White Man, I wish you understood
What the world is really like when you're living in the hood
Just because my pants are sagging doesn't mean I'm up to no good
You should try to get to know me, I really wish you would
Now my chains are gold but I'm still misunderstood
I wasn't there when Sherman's March turned the south into firewood
I want you to get paid but be a slave I never could
Feel like a new fangled Django, dodging invisible white hoods
So when I see that white cowboy hat, I'm thinking it's not all good
I guess we're both guilty of judging the cover not the book
I'd love to buy you a beer, conversate and clear the air
But I see that red flag and I think you wish I wasn't here

[Chorus: Brad Paisley (w LL Cool J ad libs) ]
I'm just a white man
(If you don't judge my do-rag)
Comin' to you from the southland
(I won't judge your red flag)
Tryin' to understand what it's like not to be
I'm proud of where I'm from
(If you don't judge my gold chains)
But not everything we've done
(I'll forget the iron chains)
It ain't like you and me can re-write history
(Can't re-write history baby)

[Verse 4]
Oh, Dixieland
(The relationship between the Mason-Dixon needs some fixin')
I hope you understand what this is all about
(Quite frankly I'm a black Yankee but I've been thinkin' about this lately)
I'm a son of the new south
(The past is the past, you feel me)
And I just want to make things right
(Let bygones be bygones)
Where all that's left is southern pride

Father, I'm prayin' for a friend he and I are pretty close, and out of all my friends for this one I'm concerned the most. He say he readin' daily but he ain't really learnin'.

He keep the Tv off, videos just make him feel that he ain't really nothin' without money, girls and shiny wheels. The other day he told me that he felt less a man coz he ain't have a five-year plan or a piece of land and man it's crazy coz his family think so much of him, plus he got a godly wife who always showin' love for him but he's strugglin', even though he talk to me, I tell him what to do but he don't listen when he oughta' be. I'm scared for him coz there's people that look up to him, he got some younger siblings who been changed by what he's done for them but is it done for him, Lord don't let it be, if he don't wanna talk to you then Father hear from me, is it done for him, Lord don't let it be, if he don't wanna talk to you then Father hear from me...

He say he tryna' trust you, doesn't wanna disgust you but he was in the mist of sinners and did not discuss you and just today his anxiety's got the best of him, he knows Christ but for hours refuse to rest in Him, he's not the best of men but Lord I know he really loves you and I can't understand why lately he's not thinkin' of you. People trust this dude, you could crush this dude, Father he needs more of you I pray you touch this dude, what can I say to him? I'm determined to pray for him Father empty and brake him I pray you'll just have your way with him, coz there's a change in him and the effects are strong, I pray you open up his heart before the next song and when he gets home, I pray he'll open up the sixty-six book love letter you wrote and soak it up coz he ain't hearin' You and he ain't feelin' me and God I know it's killin' You because it's killin' me and matter of fact there's somethin' else he's concealin' see, the person that I've been prayin' about is really me...

Yeah, life is a balance
You lose your grip, you can slip into an abyss
No doubt you see these niggas trippin'
Ego in charge of every move, he's a star
And we can't look away
Due to the days that he caught our hearts
He's fallin' apart, but we deny it
Justifying that half-ass shit he dropped
We always buy it
When he tell us he a genius
But it's clearer lately
It's been hard for him
To look into the mirror lately
There was a time
When this nigga was my hero, maybe
That's the reason why his fall
From grace is hard to take
'cause I believed him when he said his shit
Was purer and he
The type of nigga swear he real
But all around him's fake
The women, the dickriders
You know, the yes men
Nobody with the balls to say
Somethin' to contest him
So he grows out of control
Into the person that he truly was all along
It's startin' to show
Damn, wonder what happened
Maybe it's my fault for idolizing niggas
Based off the words they be rappin'
But come to find out

In the streets you know I'm eating like a lion feast
Lick a nipple tryna tickle all the finer things
Keys to the crib, keep it treal, time to handle bizz
Big dreamer, new beamer, just the realest
Cover of the source, owner of the Porsche
Killing all haters, showing no remorse
Knocking at the door, she recognize the voice
I'm not them other boys, she know I shine the most
She modeling a lot I know she on the go
Another bottle of Siroc, baby let's have a toast

I will never go hungry, go hungry again

And you're no comfort to me now
And it's fully loaded

And my wig's on crooked and I've got no jewels
I rock back and forth and I wait for you

I will never go hungry, go hungry again
Oh and I don't care what have to defend

Survived the mess you've made
Oh god can you hear us?
You're my salvation day

And it's time for me, yeah, to be a man

And I don't care what it takes my friend
I will never go hungry, go hungry again
Oh and I don't care what I have to pretend
I will never go hungry, go hungry again

And the phoenix she rises, she is sure to descend
She will never go hungry, go hungry again

Some day, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
Someday soon your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of these good old days

I was thinking about the band
I was thinking about the fans
We were underground
Loaded merch in that 12-passenger van
In a small club in Minnesota
And the snow outside of 1st Ave
I just wanted my name in a star
Now look at where we at
Still growing up
Still growing up
I'd be laying in my bed and dream about what I'd become
Couldn't wait to get older
Couldn't wait to be someone
Now that I'm here, wishing I was still young
Those good old days

I wish somebody would have told me babe
That some day these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
'Cause someday soon your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of the good old days

Wish I didn't think I had the answers
Wish I didn't drink all of that glass first
Wish I made it to homecoming
Got up the courage to ask her
Wish I would've gotten out of my shell
Wish I put the bottle back on that shelf
Wish I wouldn't have worry about what other people thought
And felt comfortable in myself
Rooftop open and the stars above
Moment frozen, sneaking out, and falling in love
Me, you and that futon, we'd just begun
On the grass, dreaming, figuring out who I was
Those good old days

I wish somebody would have told me babe
That some day these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
'Cause someday soon your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of the good old days

Never thought we'd get old
Maybe we're still young
May we always look back and think it was better than it was
Maybe these are the moments
Maybe I've been missing what it's about
Been scared of the future, thinking about the past
While missing out on now
We've come so far, I guess I'm proud
And I ain't worried about the wrinkles around my smile
I've got some scars, I've been around
I've thrown some pain, I've seen some things, but I'm here now
Those good old days

You don't know
What you've got
Till it goes, till it's gone
You don't know

And the powerless rise (and the powerless rise)
This is a kingdom born upside-down
This is a kingdom where the broken are crowned

Wait here for death

It is a broken system where suffering can never end

you didn't stand a chance son, if your pants were undone. 
`Cause you were bred for humanity and sold to society --- 
one day you'll wake up in the Present Day --- 
a million generations removed from expectations 
of being who you really want to be. 
Skating away --- 
skating away --- 
skating away on the thin ice of the New Day. 

So as you push off from the shore, 
won't you turn your head once more --- and make your peace with everyone? 
For those who choose to stay, 
will live just one more day --- 
to do the things they should have done. 
And as you cross the wilderness, spinning in your emptiness: 
you feel you have to pray. 
Looking for a sign 
that the Universal Mind (!) has written you into the Passion Play. 

Skating away on the thin ice of the New Day. 

And as you cross the circle line, the ice-wall creaks behind --- 
you're a rabbit on the run. 
And the silver splinters fly in the corner of your eye --- 
shining in the setting sun. 
Well, do you ever get the feeling that the story's 
too damn real and in the present tense? 
Or that everybody's on the stage, and it seems like 
you're the only person sitting in the audience?

At the Starbucks down on Main
I hope you understand
When I put on that t-shirt
The only thing I meant to say
Is I'm a Skynyrd fan
The red flag on my chest somehow is
Like the elephant in the corner of the south
And I just walked him right in the room
Just a proud rebel son with an 'ol can of worms
Lookin' like I got a lot to learn
But from my point of view

We're still picking up the pieces, walking on eggshells, fighting over yesterday
And caught between Southern pride and Southern blame

They called it Reconstruction, fixed the buildings, dried some tears
We're still siftin' through the rubble after a hundred-fifty years
I try to put myself in your shoes and that's a good place to begin
But it ain't like I can walk a mile in someone else's skin

[Chorus: Brad Paisley]
Cause I'm a white man livin' in the southland
Just like you I'm more than what you see
I'm proud of where I'm from but not everything we've done
And it ain't like you and me can re-write history
Our generation didn't start this nation
And we're still paying for the mistakes
That a bunch of folks made long before we came
And caught somewhere between southern pride and southern blame

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
Dear Mr. White Man, I wish you understood
What the world is really like when you're living in the hood
Just because my pants are sagging doesn't mean I'm up to no good
You should try to get to know me, I really wish you would
Now my chains are gold but I'm still misunderstood
I wasn't there when Sherman's March turned the south into firewood
I want you to get paid but be a slave I never could
Feel like a new fangled Django, dodging invisible white hoods
So when I see that white cowboy hat, I'm thinking it's not all good
I guess we're both guilty of judging the cover not the book
I'd love to buy you a beer, conversate and clear the air
But I see that red flag and I think you wish I wasn't here

[Chorus: Brad Paisley (w LL Cool J ad libs) ]
I'm just a white man
(If you don't judge my do-rag)
Comin' to you from the southland
(I won't judge your red flag)
Tryin' to understand what it's like not to be
I'm proud of where I'm from
(If you don't judge my gold chains)
But not everything we've done
(I'll forget the iron chains)
It ain't like you and me can re-write history
(Can't re-write history baby)

[Verse 4]
Oh, Dixieland
(The relationship between the Mason-Dixon needs some fixin')
I hope you understand what this is all about
(Quite frankly I'm a black Yankee but I've been thinkin' about this lately)
I'm a son of the new south
(The past is the past, you feel me)
And I just want to make things right
(Let bygones be bygones)
Where all that's left is southern pride

A rolling stone
Nowhere feels like home
And I've seen people come then they go
Life is just a story of some highs and some lows

Tell me, do you believe in miracles?
I'm standing here before your eyes

I've cried many rivers
I've walked through some pain
I've seen my world crumble
And I've carried the shame
But I know somebody, He calls me His own
I can hear Heaven singing out
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone

Everybody wants to be king
We put all our hope inside material things
In Your light I now understand
That everything I have ain't everything that I am

Oh, sometimes I feel like I'm not good enough
But that's when love says you're mine

I've cried many rivers
I've walked through some pain
I've seen my world crumble
And I've carried the shame
But I know somebody, He calls me His own

Oh, I may have took some time
But now I realize
My imperfections were a part of Your plan
And if all things work together in the end
The broken will be beautiful

There's not a hole too deep
Where God's love is not deeper still
You've come too far to give up now
Let's go!

Something in my soul 
That they cannot possess

And darkness will fade

Old lonely ass nigga... need to go and get some bitches or something
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Weird ass nigga
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
I can't even lie, I've been
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely

They say the loudest in the room is weak
That's what they assume, but I disagree
I say the loudest in the room
Is prolly the loneliest one in the room (it's me)
Attention seeker, public speaker
Oh my God, that boy is so fuckin' lonely
Writin' songs about these people
Who do not exist, he's such a fuckin' phony
One thing I know, is that I wanna
Win so bad, but I'm not Chicago
Heart is low, it's real low, it's so low
You can't lift me up, I'm like a 'Lardo
From the start it's been real dark
It's been so dark I guess that you could call it charbroiled, huh
I'm playin' like Hasbro
I'm really sorry, call me auto
Crashed the Mclaren, bought me a Tesla
I know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars (skrrt)
But what the fuck else do you want from me?
That is the only thing keepin' me company
Purchase some things until I'm annoyed
These items is fillin' the void
Been feelin' it for so long
I don't even know if it's shit I enjoy (oh)
Goin' backdoors and at door
My partner is a chateau
I need love, do you got some I could borrow?
Fuck it, I can find some tomorrow
Woah, but that never comes
Like a vasectomy, what have I done?
I got the talent, the face and the funds
Found myself long ago but I haven't found someone (who)
Mirror, mirror on the wall (who)
The loneliest of them all (me)
Cupid actin' stupid
Do you got another number I could call?
Never had a pet
I've never had a pet
There's more fish in the sea
But I never had a goldfish to begin with
I never had a dog
So I've never been good with bitches
'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch
I never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet
Treat me like direct deposit
Check in on me sometime
Ask me how I'm really doin'
So I never have to press that 911

And good fun with a hand gun.

And you don't like strong women

But you know
I come when you whistle
When you're loving and kind
But if you've got too many doubts
If there's no good reception for me
Then tune me out, 'cause honey
Who needs the static
It hurts the head
And you wind up cracking
And the day goes dismal

To the sign-off prayer
What a sorry face you get to wear

Kick off the sand cause honey

Someday we're gonna blink twice, say it happens like that
How much money we saved up for the time that we gave up
Well, it'll all just be math

Don't know how many sunsets I got left
And I don't wanna ruin
This moment by wondering what comes next
I just want to love you like it's all I'm living for
Hold you close, enjoy you more
And spend a little less time keeping score

If we're rich to somebody, we're poor to somebody else
We could be happy and nameless
Or broken and famous
But, from what I can tell
Is that it doesn't really matter
You can't take with you when you go
Life is only getting faster (Life is only getting faster)
So, baby, I'd rather take tonight nice and slow

Lays a tomb, her tree holds it

Night is so worth waiting for
A blinding scare so cauterizing
Arms out pointing, sit and stare
At this proof, this living proof
This proof, this living proof

Sun's up, braver
Hands and legs untouched
Before we forget, save this

Long may love live here

And though you're not with me now
I won't be alone

And nothing can change my memory

But all hope is gone

Now times may be tough
But we must survive
And I'd rather be dead with you
Than go on alive

For he who has loved and lost
Then loved he shall be

Counting all the cracks backwards in my best french
Reminds me of a book I skim-read in a surgery
All about palmistry I wonder what's in store for me

I pretend the plaster is the skin on my palms
And the cracks are representative of what is going on
I lose a breath... my love-line seems entwined with death

I'm thinking of you too

I lie awake at three staring at the ceiling
It's kind of off-white... maybe it's a cream
There's oily residue seepping from the kitchen
It's art-deco necromantic chic
All the dinner plates are kitsch with
Irish wolf hounds
French baguettes wrapped loose around their necks
I think I'm hungry

Last Sunday morning, the sunshine felt like rain.
Week before, they all seemed the same.
With the help of God and true friends, I come to realize
I still had two strong legs, and even wings to fly.
 
And oh I, ain't wastin time no more
'Cause time goes by like hurricanes, and faster things.
 
Lord, lord Miss Sally, why all your cryin'?
Been around here three long days, you're lookin' like you're dyin'.
Just step yourself outside, and look up at the stars above
Go on downtown baby, find somebody to love.
 
Meanwhile I ain't wastin' time no more
'Cause time goes by like pouring rain, and much faster things.
 
You don't need no gypsy to tell you why
You can't let one precious day slip by.
Look inside yourself, and if you don't see what you want,
Maybe sometimes then you don't,
But leave your mind alone and just get high.
 
Well by and by, way after many years have gone,
And all the war freaks die off, leavin' us alone.
We'll raise our children in the peaceful way we can,
It's up to you and me brother
To try and try again.
 
Well, hear us now, we ain't wastin' time no more

I wanna say what's on my motherfuckin' conscious
The whole world right now is fucking bonkers
The internet is the brand new conqueror
So watch out for the motherfuckin' monsters (yikes!)
The trolls are the taunters
Whoever controls the data got the answers
They the ones that got the code to the launcher
And they be having dinner with the Pope and the mobsters
They know the cure for the cancer
Cure for the AIDS and they probably killed the panthers
Put us in a cage got us living like hamsters
Put us in the dark but I got me a lantern
Open up my third eye, then I illuminate
Willy got a bird eye view when I elevate

Know thy self and you can do anything
Know thy self and you could shine like bling
Know thy self and you're the king, you're the ring

They don't know division, won't add to nothing
Send them off to prison when you know they did nothing

The teacher ain't teaching him nothin'
All they do was stuffin' him and stuffin' him
Stuffin' him and stuffin' him and stuffin' him
Stuffin' him and stuffin' him and stuffin' him
Stuffin' him with stuff he can't use
So he sell crack, that's what he know to do
His daddy was a hustler, so he hustle too

Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better

And slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why
Wonder what for

Is it just our bodies?
Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason
You're holding me tonight
'cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody
Just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason
You're holding me tonight

Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels

And slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws

Wonder what for

And the cracks are representative of what is going on
I lose a breath... my love-line seems entwined with death

It's kind of off-white... maybe it's a cream
There's oily residue seepping from the kitchen
It's art-deco necromantic chic

Irish wolf hounds
French baguettes wrapped loose around their necks

Yeah you learn to fly
And if you can't then you just free fall

May we all get to see
Those fields of green turn gold
Watch a marching band
Play with the harvest moon coming up
And know that fifteen minutes of famous
Ain't gonna be what makes us or breaks us but
We'll all be watching
The tv the day that it comes

May we all know that nothing ain't cool
'til you wear the new off
The sound of a quarter rollin' down a jukebox
Play the travis tritt right above the 2pac
Hope you get lost down some road
Slow rolling with the top off
The back of a bronco

Blowing out the window
Where you 'bout to go?
Yeah you learn to fly
And if you can't then you just free fall
May we all

May we all do a little bit better
Than the first time
Learn a little something from the worst times
Get a little stronger from the hurt times
May we all get to have a chance
To ride the fast one
Walk away wiser when we crashed one
Keep hoping that the best one is the last one

Meaning it's more, you see right through walls
Ain't talkin' about pussy
Meaning you deserve the whole box of chocolates
Come at me
Forrest Gump had a lot goin' for him
Never without pussy
Y'know, Jenny almost gave it all up for him
Never even pushed for the pussy
Where's Forrest now when you need him?
Talk to me, talk to me
Hey, ayy, hey
Attention, all you niggas
All you bitches

Sit back and relax, you'll find just why, just why
Sit back, relax, just ease your mind, just ride

Niggas'll lose they mind for it
Wine for it, dine for it-pussy
Spend time for it, see no colored line for it-pussy
Double back handicap and go blind for it-pussy
Pussy got endless prisoners
Pussy always revengin' her
Pussy is calculating
And good pussy is rather dangerous
Pussy can be so facetious, the heavyweight champ
Pussy is so undefeated, let's amen to that
I mean, the pump fakes on the Facebooks
And the screw face when the bae look
Won't get you no pussy
I mean, the fake chains and the gold names
For insecure, gon' reassure you not to get pussy
You overcompensate too much for the pussy
You like to throw all kinda shade for the pussy
See, that's what pussy niggas do
I know the ways of a pussy, I see pussy lookin' at you
How many niggas get mistaken for clitoris in a day?
How many sentiments you make before runnin' pussy away?
How many times she gotta tell you that dick is disposable?
But if she fuck a young nigga like me, it's over for you
Solána, middle fingers up, speak your truth

You could never trivialize pussy
But a bum nigga like you would try it (pussy)
I know what you really 'bout
High key, your dick is weak, buddy
It's only replaced by a rubber substitute
We ain't feelin' you
Think I caught a vibe, kinda feel a nigga
You could touch the booty if you like, I ain't trippin' on ya
(Such a nice girl, Sza)
I'm really tryna crack off that headboard
And bust it wide open for the right one
Is you that for me?
'Cause if you that for me
Like doves in the wind, hey, hey
That pussy, like doves in the wind, hey, hey
Pussy like doves in the wind
I will make you beg for it
I wanna see you call out

Sit back and relax your mind, just ride
(Give you all of me and I won't stop, not a little bit)
Sit back and relax, you'll find just why
(Dangerous boy, I wanted to do it all)
Sit back, relax, just ease your mind, just ride

We take things, and my influence so far, and then it's out of my hands. And, y'know, while as I said it can be scary, it can also be a little bit comforting.

And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again

Damn, who knew
All the planes we flew
Good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
About another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up look at things different
See the bigger picture
Those were the days
Hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place

Oh
How could we not talk about family
When family's all that we got?
Everything I went through
You were standing there by my side
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride

It's been a long day, without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

First, you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turn to a friendship
A friendship turned into a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached
So remember me when I'm gone

How could we not talk about family
When family's all that we got?
Everything I went through
You were standing there by my side
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride

So let the light guide your way
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home

Need a paradox for the pair of dots they tutored
Like two ties, L-L, you lose two times

It ain? t complex to put it in context
Find the air beneath the kite, that? s the context
Yeah, baby, I? m conscious, ain? t no contest
If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed
Ain? t no stress, jigga boos wanna be
I ain? t talkin? Jay, I ain? t talkin? Bey
I? m talkin? days we got school watchin? movie screens
And spike yourself esteem
The new James Bond gon? be black as me
Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea
And it? s all beautiful to me
Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens

How can this be home when I feel I wanna flee here?

Paranoia got the gang'nem rolling with it lately
Feelin' like they're gonna run up in my crib and take me (Told me turn')
So rest in peace Mark, you're forever in our prayers

So we can move forward without turnin' back pages
No more feelin' like strangers in this world that we live in
Uh, Lord, forgive them (Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn)
No more betrayal, we need permanent changes
So we can move forward without turnin' back pages (Ah)

Thinking he would only think back
To this and never find
Better times to think back to when it comes
And he's older in the presence of somebody young
Telling him the same things that he told me
And he reacts the same way as that OG

How can you show your face,
When you're a disgrace to the human race?

No committment, you're an embarrassment,
Yes, an embarrassment, a living endorsement,
The intention that you have booked,
Was an intention that was overlooked.

Don't want you home today,
Keep away from our door,
Don't come 'round here no more.

This is a serious matter,
Too late to reconsider,
No one's gonna wanna know ya !

It was a long march from cadets
The sixth battalion was the next to tour, and it was me who drew the card
We did Canungra, Shoalwater before we left 

And Townsville lined the footpaths as we marched down to the quay
This clipping from the paper shows us young and strong and clean
And there's me in my slouch hat with my SLR and greens
God help me, I was only nineteen 

From Vung Tau, riding Chinooks, to the dust at Nui Dat
I'd been in and out of choppers now for months
But we made our tents a home, VB and pinups on the lockers
And an Asian orange sunset through the scrub

And can you tell me, doctor, why I stil can't get to sleep?
And night-time's just a jungle dark and a barking M16?
And what's this rash that comes and goes, can you tell me what it means?
God help me, I was only ninteen 

A four week operation when each step could mean your last one on two legs
It was a war within yourself
But you wouldn't let your mates down til they had you dusted off
So you closed your eyes and thought about something else 

Then someone yelled out ""Contact!"" and the bloke behind me swore
We hooked in there for hours, then a Godalmighty roar
Frankie kicked a mine the day that mankind kickedthemoon God help me, he was going home in June 

I can still see Frankie, drinking tinnies in the Grand Hotel
On a thirty-six hour rec leave in Vung Tau
And I can still hear Frankie, lying screaming in the jungle
Til the morphine came and killed the bloody row 

And the Anzac legends didn't mention mud and blood and tears
And the stories that my father told me never seemed quite real
I caught some pieces in my back that I didn't even feel
God help me, I was only nineteen 

And can you tell me, doctor, why I still can't get to sleep?
And why the Channel Seven chopper chills me to my feet?
And what's this rash that comes and goes, can you tell me what it means?

A perfect Texas afternoon
A mother and two children
Play the way they always do
As they raced home from the mailbox
A mother and her son
Against a little girl of 6 years old
The independent one

The deputies went door to door
Through all the neighborhood
They said I got some news to tell you folks
I’m afraid it ain’t so good
Somehow something happened
Someone got away
Someone got the answers
For what happened here today
Oh no, ho no, oh no, no, no, no

Tell me it was just a dream – August 7, 4:15
God close His eyes & the world got mean
August 7, 4:15

Now the people from the papers
And the local TV  news
Tried to find the reason
Cop dogs sniffed around for clues
Someone shouted “Hit & Run”
The coroner cried “Foul”
Her blue dress was what she wore
The day they laid her body down
Oh no, ho no, oh no, no, no, no

Tell me it was just a dream – August 7, 4:15

Up on Heaven’s highest hill
And no one there can hurt you baby
No one ever will
Somewhere someone’s conscience
Is like a burning bed
The flames are all around you
How you gonna sleep again

Blowin' tiger stripe bubbles with

And grandmum tells me to stay humble but do not un-der-stand
When they leave mumbles to make 'em throw up they arms

Now stumble and they will know I put on my pants

And I encourage any child to pick up some instrument
Cuz if you're mad at your dad or mum,

Past the racism and fake-ism
Type of hate that make you feel worse than a rape victim, raw dogs
You other niggas mad soft, mad I rap my ass off

On wax, spitting heat to melt the wax off

Now I'm onto grand raps, hands so low, uh
It's like my fashion style is the life saver
Guess she wasn't satisfied with titties that Christ gave her
Bragging that her new ass shots is a life changer
Head so good on that girl that I might pay her, or nah
Super laid back cat, opposite of fat black, Al Capone
Tell them lil' niggas Flacko home

Roll through the city, that chose to resent me
Hold it, don't load it, reload it

Pissed me off then tried to hold it against me
Or wish we off the worst of luck that ever hated

Is stored in my memory all of the thoughts that I thought of
Means more for my enemies
Sippin' holy water like it's bore from my kidneys
Load the smoke like a chimney, make a toast for the memories
Make a toast for the henny, it's the best for the remedies

Finna get advantage on him and his nemesis

I changed my name in search of fame
To find the Midas touch
Oh I wish I'd never wanted then
What I want now twice as much
We crossed the mighty oceans
And we had a few divides
But we never crossed emotion
For we felt too much inside

You know all the tales we tell
You know the band so well
Still I feel, somehow, we let you down
We went off somewhere on the way
And now I see we have to pay
The rock'n'roll circus is in town

Buffin lost his child-like dreams
And Mick lost his guitar
And Verden grew a line or two
And Overend's just a rock'n'roll star
Behind these shades the visions fade
As I learn a thing or two
Oh but if I had my time again
You all know just what I'd do

Rock'n'roll's a loser's game
It mesmerises and I can't explain
The reasons for the sights and for the sounds
We went off somewhere on the way
And now I see we have to pay
The rock'n'roll circus is in town

So Rock'n'roll's a loser's game
It mesmerises and I can't explain
The reasons for the sights and for the sounds
The greasepaint still sticks to my face
So what the hell, I can't erase
The rock'n'roll feeling from my mind

From my mind...from my mind...from my mind

I bust a nut, and then I'm breakin' out
So when you're naked, down on all fours
You better make sure that you get yours
'Cause a nigga like me will love ya and leave ya
I got mine, hoe!  SEE YA!

They stay out all night on the basketball court
Practicing, and practicing their jump shot
Practicing their hook-shot
And practicing and practicing, 
and then they're qualified for the majors
Well why can't you stay up all night 
practicing your multiplication
Practicing your Chemistry, practicing your Physics
Why can't you stay up practicing that?!

then why do you just specialize in fun things

14172,14172,Songs about marital problems or divorce,Bad Husband,Eminem,"We never saw from each other's sides, or eye to eye
Just eye for eye, lie for lie, fight or flight
So much baggage, need a luggage rack
But we carry on with our public spats and our feuds
Oh, back in the news, love taps when I dissed you
Like it was fun, actually used to run
Back to the booth, jump back in the studio
Give you a tongue lashing then you
Laughed at a stomach tat with the tomb stone
It was funny, back in our youth
But then it wasn't after we knew
That we were done and actually through (and actually through)
But if there's one fraction of truth
If it could be spun back I would do so many things different
'Cause it was such a dumbass excuse
You hit me once, and that I would use
To continue the pattern of abuse
Why did I punch back?
Girls, your dad is a scumbag
I'm confused because

How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband?

You were the beat I love, with a writer's block
Just a line that's hot, that I forgot
We laughed a little, cried a lot
I'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailie
Day before you went to jail and daily
How we would wait for that mail lady
Or by the phone, for mom to call
And I watch you pull yourself up
And we decided on giving it one more try despite it all
You're my lightning rod when my sky gets dark
I'm your shiny rocks in that tiny box
When we tied the knot, when we broke the knot
Every line we crossed, we were supposed to not
Every time we fought, the insults they got
Thrown too far
Words that we said that we didn't mean
The words that we meant that we didn't say
The ones that we thought that should've said
Letters written that we coulda read
Which maybe woulda lead to some good instead
And had this put to bed
But I'd be lying still if I wasn't sitting here asking myself

How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband
(dad) (you said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
But there's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband

We brought out the worst in each other
Someone had to make the sparring end
'Cause I loved you but I hated that me
And I don't wanna see that side again
But I'm sorry Kim
More than you could ever comprehend
Leaving you was fucking harder than
Sawing off a fucking body limb
Once upon a time where all we had
Maybe that was what drew us to each other
It was true love shit that we never knew was possible
We might have loved each other too much
And maybe that's what made us do what we did to each other
All the screw-ups
'Cause you always thought that you was more in love with me
And I was thinking I was more in love than you was
For all the times that we thought it worked
'Til we saw how wrong we were
When the dust settles now and all the dirt
And if I touch the rawest nerve all I want is for us not to hurt
And it's been an exhaustive search to find the words
But I just heard ""Mockingbird""
And got the urge to jot some verses and thoughts
The purpose was not to stir up open wounds
I've caused got a few, and so have you
Or argue whose fault it was, partly yours, partly mine
But really no one's, this is so tough
I'm getting choked up
Oh fuck it, we both suck
We broke up, got back together
We both thought we had forever
Not bad people, just bad together
We were so nuts, backstabbed each other
Another blow struck, but there's no ducking this blow
'Cause it's over, and it's closure
But, I'm not so sure how to close this, I just don't know
How some people can be so good
At one thing and so fucked at a whole 'nother
Shit, it's no wonder

How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?

Rather swim with the piranhas or the shark

 And taught their English to our young
 And all the beads we made by hand

Jerusalem, if I forget you,
fire not gonna come from me tongue.
Jerusalem, if I forget you,
let my right hand forget what it’s supposed to do.

In the ancient days, we will return with no delay
Picking up the bounty and the spoils on our way
We’ve been traveling from state to state
And them don’t understand what they say
3,000 years with no place to be
And they want me to give up my milk and honey
Don’t you see, it’s not about the land or the sea
Not the country but the dwelling of his majesty

[chorus]

Rebuild the temple and the crown of glory
Years gone by, about sixty
Burn in the oven in this century
And the gas tried to choke, but it couldn’t choke me
I will not lie down, I will not fall asleep
They come overseas, yes they’re trying to be free
Erase the demons out of our memory
Change your name and your identity
Afraid of the truth and our dark history
Why is everybody always chasing we
Cut off the roots of your family tree
Don't you know that's not the way to be

[chorus]

Caught up in these ways, and the worlds gone craze
Don’t you know it’s just a phase
Case of the Simon says
If I forget the truth then my words won’t penetrate
Babylon burning in the place, can’t see through the haze
Chop down all of them dirty ways,
That’s the price that you pay for selling lies to the youth
No way, not ok, oh no way, not ok, hey
Aint no one gonna break my stride
Aint no one gonna pull me down
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
Stay alive

I've seen the bridges of the world and they are for real/
I've had a red light off-the-wrist without me even getting kissed
It still seems so unreal

I've seen the morning in the mountains of Alaska
I've seen the sunset in the East and in the West                /
I've sang the glory that was Rome And passed the 'Hound Dog' singer's home

And I'm far, far  a-way
With my head up in the clouds
And I'm far, far  a-way
With my feet down in the crowds
Letting loose around the world
But the call of home is loud
Still as loud

I've seen the Paris lights from high upon Montmartre
And felt the silence hanging low in No Man's Land/          /
And though those Spanish nights were fine  It wasn't only from the wine
It still seems all in hand

And though those aligator smiles  Stay in your memory for a while
There still seems more to come

Now I can't pledge allegiance to your flag
Cause I can't find no reconciliation with your past
When there was nothing equal for my people in your math
You forced us in the ghetto and then you took our dads
The belly of the beast, these streets are demons' abs
I'm telling you that setup in them sit-ups is so sad
The system is a slab
Corruption is the swinger sittin' high ridin' dirty, 
drag racin' into danger
And it's so clean, pine trees smellin' good
With work off in the trunk and niggas in the hood
So I can't shed blood on any battlefield of yours
I pray the ugly truth comes and shatters your decor
And as it all falls down and tatters on the floor
I shed tears, I don't know what really matters anymore
Cause I don't know what really matters anymore

Now as I wander through the city goin' mad
I see the fruits of planting evidence instead of grass
A swindled generation with no patience, full of swag
Man, they so impatient with the stations that they have
As long as they look good when they be doin' bad
Then the separation from the truth is gettin' vast, fast
Be a slave at first or free at last
Double-edged choices make a nigga wanna pass
Double-headed voices from the eagle on the staff
The pyramid where eyes will split the spirited in half
Divided over money
Delighted by the dummyin' 
down of the importance of crowns we'll never have
That's why my sounds and sermons are so full of wrath
Baptize your mind, let your brain take a bath
Swim inside the river get delivered from the craft
Of the witches in this business that be livin' off your sad
Hatin' on your happiness you hit 'em off with laughs
Smile 'til they surrender, then you kill 'em off with glad
Hello evil, I'm back

Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day begin
Before my mother starts bitchin' about my friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip
With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride
I got front back, and side to side
Then I let the Alpine play
Bumpin new shit by NWA
It was ""Gangsta Gangsta"" at the top of the list
Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this :

Cruisin' down the street in my 4
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the ho's
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckle-heads out there cold shootin' some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rollin Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
It's all about makin' that GTA

Cuz the boyz in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit'
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't said shit...

[]

Donald B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JD is on freebase
The boy JD was a friend of mine
'Till I caught him in my car tryin' to steal a Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly mothafucka pulled out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gage
One sucker dead, L.A. times front page

Cuz the boyz in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit'
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't said shit...

Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill
The fellows out there - makin' that dollar
I pulled up in my 64 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'
And from the 8-ball my breath start stinkin'
Love to get my girl, to rock that body
Before I left I hit the bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb ho said something that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the ho'
Her father jumped out and he started to shout
So I threw a right-cross and knocked his old ass out

Cuz the boyz in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit'
Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't said shit...

[]

I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control
Then wrapped the 64 'round the telephone poll
I looked at my car and I said ""oh brother""
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another
Walkin' home and I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin' Kilo on the side
As they busted a U they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Kat got beat for resistin' arrest
He socked the pig in his head for rippin' his Guess
Now G is caught for doin' the crime
Forth afence on the boy, he'll do some time

Cuz the boyz in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card

I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellows Caused a riot in the county jail
Two days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial cold cut a fart
Disruption of a court, said the judge
On a six years sentence my man didn't budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out ""FIRE!"", then came Suzi

The bitch came in with a sub-machine Uzi
Police shot the bitch but didn't hurt her
Both up state for attempted murder

Cuz the boyz in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card

Thinking he would only think back
To this and never find
Better times to think back to when it comes
And he's older in the presence of somebody young
Telling him the same things that he told me
And he reacts the same way as that OG
But it's old school, it's like 'O3
And this old man is my old me
Takes a long time to happen so fast
To realize that your future is somebody else's past

Melli Mel's, Ice-T's, and the 2 Cools
Add a Moe Dee and a Double L
Had to walk cause it's hard to run
In those unbuckled shells
One microphone and a couple 12s
Six drum sounds and a couple bells
Is all you had to make a couple rails
And that's a trap, and if you want it (eeh)
You have to make it like that (like that)
Now what's one turtle to a couple snails?
Takes a long time to happen so fast
And realize your future is somebody else's past

Chiraq summer looking so cruel
How can I reel-to-reel when there's Pro Tool?
I can't dig it at all because there's no tube
Fire when you speak
But ain't no warmth in your vocals
Might have been a better rhyme then just never mind
If it's better with time then think in line
That you're going to be your nicest
'Round your midlife crisis
If your life like Christ live your midlife
Like it's... Christ-like
Now I ain't psychic
I know it's all a cycle and everybody bike it
And France is enormous
You're Lance with endorsements
But you might need a hand
To enhance your performance
Consider this a kilogram of encouragement
Teach you how to sneak it past the enforcement
And when you get it through in a manner so cool
Remember to give a little nod to the old school

And I can hear them celebrating every time I up and leave the room

Now my friends all came to see me they point at me and stare
Said he's just like the rest of us so what's he doing in there
They hide in their movie theaters drinking juice-keeping tight
'Cause they're certain about one thing that zoo's no place to spend the

God is better than the best thing that the world has to offer
[verse 1: chance the rapper]
Magnify, magnify, lift it on high
Spit it spotify to qualify a spot on his side
I cannot modify or ratify, my momma made me apple pies
Lullabies and alibis
The book don't end with malachi
Devil will win employee of the month by the dozen
'til one score and three years
From the third when he doesn't
My village raised 'em a child
Come through the crib and it's bustin'
You meet anyone from my city, they gon' say that we cousins
Shabach barak, edify
Electrify the enemy like hedwig till he petrified
Any petty peter petigrew could get the pesticide
79Th, 79th, I don't believe in science
I believe in signs
Don't believe in signing, I seen dollar signs
Color white collar crime
Good god, the gift of freedom
Hosanna santa invoked and woke up slaves
From southampton to chatham manor
My dream girl's behind me, feel like I'm james early
The type of worship make jesus come back a day early
With the faith of a pumpkin-seed-sized mustard seed
Hear, for I will speak noble things as entrusted me
Only righteous, I might just shrug at the skullduggery
I couldn't stand to see another rapper lose custody
Exalt, exalt, glorify
Descend upon the earth with swords
And fortify the borders where your shorties lie
I used to hide from god
Ducked down in the slums like ""shh""

[verse 2: jay electronica]
I was lost in the jungle like simba after the death of mufasa
No hog, no meerkat, hakuna matata by day
But I spent my night time fighting tears back
I prayed and prayed and left messages
But never got no hear back, or so it seemed
A mustard seed was all I needed to sow a dream
I build the ark to gently, gently
Row my boat down noah's stream
Sometimes the path I took to reach
My petty goals was so extreme
I was so far down in the mud couldn't even let my light shine
But you was always there
When I needed to phone a friend or use a life line
From a lofty height we wage war
On the poltergeist with the exalted christ
Spark the dark with the pulse of light
Strike a corpse with a pulse of life
I spit on the tidal it's tidal waves
I spit on the apple and kill a worm
A fire in cali will swallow a valley
For every african village burned
Jay elect would've never made it
O' son of man, o' son of man
Who was the angel in revelations with a foot
On water and a foot on land?
Who was the angel that rode a harley from
The project to the house of parliament
And opened the book in the devil's chamber
And put the true name of the lord in it?
Old jerusalem, new jerusalem
Comes like this beast with a ball of fire
They poisoned the scriptures
And gave us the pictures of false messiahs
It was all a lie

Satan's establishment crumbling down

The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I'm chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
20 on pump six dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
20 years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend all my ear or two 
how to stack these residuals
Tenfold, the liberal concept of what men'll do
20 on 6, he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu
My American tongue was slurry
Walked out the gas station
A homeless man with a silly tan complexion
Asked me for ten grand
Stressin' about dry land
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
A piece of crack that he wanted,
I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it
Told him, ""Beat it""
Contributin' money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it
He said, ""My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothin' less, nothin' more
I told him I ain't have it and closed my door
Tell me how much a dollar cost

 (James Fauntleroy)
It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe

He's starin' at me in disbelief
My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me,
 I grab my key
He's starin' at me, I started my car 
and tried to leave
And somethin' told me to keep it in park 
until I could see
A reason why he was mad at a stranger
like I was supposed to save him
Like I'm the reason he's homeless 
and askin' me for a favor
He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me 
with no laser
He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious
Cause now I'm starin' back at him, 
feelin' some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him,
it'd be aimin' at his neck
I never understood someone beggin' for goods
Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could
And this particular person just had it down pat
Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked
Have you ever opened to Exodus 14?
A humble man is all that we ever need
Tell me how much a dollar cost


Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment
I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin'
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?
So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum,
crumbs and pennies
I need all of mines
and I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time
I got better judgement, I know when nigga's hustlin'
Keep in mind, when I was strugglin', 
I did compromise
Now I comprehend, I smell grandpa's old medicine
Reekin' from your skin, moonshine and gin
Nigga your babblin', your words ain't flatterin', 
I'm imaginin'
Denzel be lookin' at O'Neal
Cause now I'm in sad thrills, 
your gimmick is mediocre
the jig is up
I seen you from a mile away losin' focus
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy
You looked at me and said, ""Your potential is bittersweet""
I looked at him and said, ""Every nickel is mines to keep""
He looked at me and said, ""Know the truth, it'll set you free
You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehova,
the higher power
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit, the nerve
Of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
The price of having a spot in Heaven
embrace your loss, I am God""

Oh! England, my Lionheart, 
I don't want to go. 

Oh! England, my Lionheart! 
Dropped from my black Spitfire to my funeral barge. 
Give me one kiss in apple-blossom. 
Give me one wish, and I'd be wassailing 
In the orchard, my English rose, 
Or with my shepherd, who'll bring me home. 

Oh! England, my Lionheart, 
Oh! England, my Lionheart, 
Oh! England, my Lionheart, 
I don't want to go. 
Oh! England, my Lionheart, 
Oh! England, my Lionheart,

26617,26617,Songs with political statements,The Riot's Gone,Santigold,"I've been looking for a fight
All the trouble that I know
Trying to loose the world inside
But it's got no place to go

Oh, I'm only dangerous at the whim of my command
I've been searching for an angle
For a cause I can defend

Oh take me home
Let me go all day
Just be here til I know
Til I know that the riot's gone, the riot's gone away

I've been haunted all my life
On the brink of something close
People know that I write
Know I'm grappling with a ghost

Oh I'm only dangerous, and I'm deafened by the fright
Waiting for the day I'm able
And I said it all this way

Oh take me home
Let me go all day
Just be here til I know
Til I know that the riot's gone, the riot's gone away",aprox,200,The Riots Gone
